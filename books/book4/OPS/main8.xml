<div class="text">
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was longer than
the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our
first plans—not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him—could
be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a
physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at
work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old
Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams
and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and
adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the
details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the
housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every
possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed
a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and
from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects.
Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought,
sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my
fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual
adventures.</p>
<p>So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter
addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, "To be opened, in the
case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins." Obeying this
order, we found, or rather I found—for the gamekeeper was a poor
hand at reading anything but print—the following important
news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17—</p>
<p>Dear Livesey—As I do not know whether you&#160;are at the hall
or still in London, I send this in&#160;double to both places.</p>
<p>The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at&#160;anchor, ready
for sea. You never imagined a&#160;sweeter schooner—a child might
sail her—two&#160;hundred tons; name, Hispaniola.</p>
<p>I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who&#160;has proved
himself throughout the most surprising&#160;trump. The admirable
fellow literally slaved in&#160;my interest, and so, I may say, did
everyone in&#160;Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port
we&#160;sailed for—treasure, I mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Redruth," said I, interrupting the letter, "Dr. Livesey will
not like that. The squire has been talking, after all."</p>
<p>"Well, who's a better right?" growled the gamekeeper. "A pretty
rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should
think."</p>
<p>At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight
on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blandly himself found the Hispaniola, and&#160;by the most
admirable management got her for the&#160;merest trifle. There is a
class of men in Bristol&#160;monstrously prejudiced against
Blandly. They go&#160;the length of declaring that this honest
creature&#160;would do anything for money, that the
Hispaniola&#160;belonged to him, and that he sold it me
absurdly&#160;high—the most transparent calumnies. None of
them&#160;dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.</p>
<p>Wo far there was not a hitch. The&#160;workpeople, to be
sure—riggers and what not—were&#160;most annoyingly slow; but time
cured that. It was&#160;the crew that troubled me.</p>
<p>I wished a round score of men—in case of&#160;natives,
buccaneers, or the odious French—and I&#160;had the worry of the
deuce itself to find so much&#160;as half a dozen, till the most
remarkable stroke&#160;of fortune brought me the very man that
I&#160;required.</p>
<p>I was standing on the dock, when, by the&#160;merest accident, I
fell in talk with him. I found&#160;he was an old sailor, kept a
public-house, knew&#160;all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost
his&#160;health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to&#160;get
to sea again. He had hobbled down there that&#160;morning, he said,
to get a smell of the salt.</p>
<p>I was monstrously touched—so would you have&#160;been—and, out
of pure pity, I engaged him on the&#160;spot to be ship's cook.
Long John Silver, he is&#160;called, and has lost a leg; but that I
regarded as&#160;a recommendation, since he lost it in
his&#160;country's service, under the immortal Hawke. He&#160;has
no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable</p>
<p>age we live in!</p>
<p>Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook,&#160;but it was a
crew I had discovered. Between&#160;Silver and myself we got
together in a few days a&#160;company of the toughest old salts
imaginable—not&#160;pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces,
of&#160;the most indomitable spirit. I declare we could&#160;fight
a frigate.&#160;Long John even got rid of two out of the
six&#160;or seven I had already engaged. He showed me in
a&#160;moment that they were just the sort of
fresh-water&#160;swabs we had to fear in an adventure of</p>
<p>importance.</p>
<p>I am in the most magnificent health and&#160;spirits, eating
like a bull, sleeping like a tree,&#160;yet I shall not enjoy a
moment till I hear my old&#160;tarpaulins tramping round the
capstan. Seaward,&#160;ho! Hang the treasure! It's the glory of the
sea&#160;that has turned my head. So now, Livesey, come&#160;post;
do not lose an hour, if you respect me.</p>
<p>Let young Hawkins go at once to see his&#160;mother, with
Redruth for a guard; and then both&#160;come full speed to
Bristol.</p>
<p>John Trelawney</p>
<p>Postscript—I did not tell you that Blandly,&#160;who, by the
way, is to send a consort after us if&#160;we don't turn up by the
end of August, had found&#160;an admirable fellow for sailing
master—a stiff&#160;man, which I regret, but in all other respects
a&#160;treasure. Long John Silver unearthed a very&#160;competent
man for a mate, a man named Arrow. I&#160;have a boatswain who
pipes, Livesey; so things&#160;shall go man-o'-war fashion on board
the good ship&#160;Hispaniola.</p>
<p>I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of&#160;substance; I
know of my own knowledge that he has&#160;a banker's account, which
has never been&#160;overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the
inn;&#160;and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of
old&#160;bachelors like you and I may be excused for&#160;guessing
that it is the wife, quite as much as the&#160;health, that sends
him back to roving.</p>
<p>J. T.</p>
<p>P.P.S.—Hawkins may stay one night with his&#160;mother.</p>
<p>J. T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I
was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it
was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament.
Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with
him; but such was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's
pleasure was like law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would
have dared so much as even to grumble.</p>
<p>The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral
Benbow, and there I found my mother in good health and spirits. The
captain, who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was
gone where the wicked cease from troubling. The squire had had
everything repaired, and the public rooms and the sign repainted,
and had added some furniture—above all a beautiful armchair for
mother in the bar. He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so
that she should not want help while I was gone.</p>
<p>It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time,
my situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures
before me, not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at
sight of this clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place
beside my mother, I had my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led
that boy a dog's life, for as he was new to the work, I had a
hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down,
and I was not slow to profit by them. The night passed, and the
next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were afoot again and on the
road. I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived
since I was born, and the dear old Admiral Benbow—since he was
repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last thoughts was of
the captain, who had so often strode along the beach with his
cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope. Next
moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.</p>
<p>The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the
heath. I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman,
and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air, I must
have dozed a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a
log up hill and down dale through stage after stage, for when I was
awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my
eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in
a city street and that the day had already broken a long time.</p>
<p>"Where are we?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Bristol," said Tom. "Get down."</p>
<p>Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the
docks to superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now
to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and
beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and
nations. In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another
there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that
seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore
all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then.
The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most
wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw,
besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers
curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,
clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I
could not have been more delighted.</p>
<p>And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a
piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for
an unknown island, and to seek for buried treasure!</p>
<p>While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in
front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like
a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a
smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.</p>
<p>"Here you are," he cried, "and the doctor came last night from
London. Bravo! The ship's company complete!"</p>
<p>"Oh, sir," cried I, "when do we sail?"</p>
<p>"Sail!" says he. "We sail tomorrow!"</p>
