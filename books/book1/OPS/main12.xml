War — Red War!</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>PITY FLOODED me. The shadow of greatness that had cloaked Ghast
Rhymi was gone. He sat there, a shrunken, fragile old man, and I
felt a momentary unreasoning impulse to turn on my heel and leave
him to drift back into his peaceful abyss of thought. Once, I
remembered, Ghast Rhymi had seemed a tall, huge figure — though he
had never been that in my lifetime. But in my childhood I had sat
at the feet of this Covenanter and looked up with awe at that
majestic, bearded face with reverence.</p>
<p>Perhaps there had been more life in that face then, more warmth
and humanity. It was remote now. It was like the face of a god, or
of one who had looked upon too many gods.</p>
<p>My tongue stumbled.</p>
<p>"Master," I said. "I am sorry!"</p>
<p>No light came into the distant blue gaze, yet I sensed a
stirring.</p>
<p>"You name me master?" he said. "You — Ganelon? It has been a
long time since you humbled yourself to anyone."</p>
<p>The taste of my triumph was ashes. I bowed my head. Yes, I had
conquered Ghast Rhymi, and I did not like the savor of that
conquest.</p>
<p>"In the end the circle completes itself," the old man said
quietly. "We are more kin than the others. Both you and I are
human, Ganelon, not mutants. Because I am Leader of the Coven I let
Medea and the others use my wisdom. But — but — " He hesitated.</p>
<p>"For two decades my mind has dwelt in shadow," he went on.
"Beyond good and evil, beyond life and the figures that move like
puppets on the stream of life. When I was wakened, I would give the
answers I knew. It did not matter. I had thought that I had lost
all touch with reality. And that if death swept over every man and
woman in the Dark World, it would not matter."</p>
<p>I could not speak. I knew that I had done Ghast Rhymi a very
great wrong in wakening him from his deep peace.</p>
<p>The blue stars dwelt on me.</p>
<p>"And I find that it does matter, after all. No blood of mine
runs in your veins, Ganelon. Yet we are kin. I taught you, as I
would have taught my own son. I trained you for your task — to rule
the Coven in my place. And now, I think I regret many things. Most
of all the answer I gave the Covenanters after Medea brought you
back from Earth-world."</p>
<p>"You told them to kill me," I said.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"Matholch was afraid. Edeyrn sided with him. They made Medea
agree. Matholch said, 'Ganelon is changed. There is danger. Let the
old man read the future and see what it holds.' So they came to me,
and I let my mind ride the winds of time and see what lay
ahead."</p>
<p>"And that was —?"</p>
<p>"The end of the Coven," Ghast Rhymi said. "If you lived. I
foresaw the arms of Llyr reaching into the Dark World, and Matholch
lying dead in a shadowed place, and doom upon Edeyrn and Medea. For
time is fluid, Ganelon. It changes as men change. The probabilities
alter. When you went into Earth-world, you Were Ganelon. But you
came back with a double mind. You have the memories of Edward Bond,
which you can use as tools. Medea should have left you in
Earth-world. But she loved you."</p>
<p>"Yet she agreed to let them kill me," I said.</p>
<p>"Do you know what was in her thoughts?" Ghast Rhymi asked. "In
Caer Secaire, at the time of sacrifice, Llyr would come. And you
have been sealed to Llyr. Did Medea think you could be killed,
then?"</p>
<p>A doubt grew within me. But Medea had led me, like a sheep to
slaughter, in the procession to the Caer. If she could justify
herself, let her. I knew that Edeyrn and Matholch could not.</p>
<p>"I may let Medea live, then," I said. "But not the wolfling. I
have already promised his life. And as for Edeyrn, she must
perish."</p>
<p>I showed Ghast Rhymi the Crystal Mask. He nodded.</p>
<p>"But Llyr?"</p>
<p>"I was sealed to Him as Ganelon," I said. "Now you say I have
two minds. Or, at least, an extra set of memories, even though they
are artificial. I am not willing to be liege to Llyr! I learned
many things in the-Earth-world. <em>Llyr is no god!"</em></p>
<p>The ancient head bent. A transparent hand rose and touched the
ringlets of the beard. Then Ghast Rhymi looked at me, and he
smiled.</p>
<p>"So you know that, do you?" he asked. "I will tell you
something, Ganelon, that no one else has guessed. You are not the
first to come from Earth-world to the Dark World. I was the
first."</p>
<p>I stared at him with unconcealed amazement.</p>
<p>"And you were born in the Dark World; I was not," he said. "My
flesh sprang from the dust of Earth. It has been very long since I
crossed, and I can never return now, for my span is long outlived.
Only here can I keep the life-spark burning within me, though I do
not much care about that either. Yet I am Earth-born, and I knew
Vortigern and the kings of Wales. I had my own holdings at
Caer-Merdin, and a different sun from this red ember in the Dark
World's sky shone upon Caer-Merdin! Blue sky, blue sea of Britain,
the gray stones of the Druid altars under the oak forests. That is
my home, Ganelon. <em>Was</em> my home. Until my science, that men
in those days called magic, brought me here, with a woman's aid. A
Dark-World woman named Viviane."</p>
<p>"You are Earth-born?" I said.</p>
<p>"Once — yes. As I grew older here, very, very old, I regretted
my exile. I had acquired enough of wisdom. I would have changed it
all for one breath of the cool, sweet air that blew in from the
Irish Sea when I was a boy. But never could I return. My body would
fall to dust in the Earth-world. So I lost myself in dreams —
dreams of Earth, Ganelon."</p>
<p>His blue eyes brightened with memories.</p>
<p>His voice deepened.</p>
<p>"In my dreams I brought back the old days. I stood again on the
crags of Wales, watching the salmon leaping in the waters of gray
Usk. I saw Artorius again, and his father Uther, and I smelled the
old smells of Britain in her youth. But they were dreams!</p>
<p>"And dreams are not enough. For the sake of the love I bore the
dust from which I sprang, for the sake of a wind that blew from
ancient Ireland, I will help you now, Ganelon. I had never thought
that life would matter to me any more. But that these abominations
should lead a man of Earth to slaughter — no! And man of Earth you
are now, though born on this world of sorcery!"</p>
<p>He leaned forward, compelling me with his gaze.</p>
<p>"You are right. Llyr is no god. He is — a monster. No more than
that. And he can be slain."</p>
<p>"With the Sword Called Llyr?"</p>
<p>"Listen. Put these legends out of your mind. That is Llyr's
power, and the power of the Dark World. All is veiled in mystic
symbols of terror. But behind the veil lies simple truth. Vampire,
werewolf, upas-tree — they all are biological freaks, mutations run
wild! And the First mutation was Llyr. His birth split the one
time-world into two, each spinning along its line of probability.
He was a key factor in the temporal pattern of entropy.</p>
<p>"Listen again. At birth, Llyr was human. But his mind was not as
the minds of others. He had certain natural powers, latent powers,
which ordinarily would not have developed in the race for a million
years. Because they did develop in him too soon, they were warped
and distorted, and put to evil ends. In the future world of logic
and science, his mental powers would have fitted. In the dark times
of superstition, they did not fit too well. So he developed, with
the science at his command and the mental strength he had, into a
monster.</p>
<p>"Human once. Less human as he grew older and wiser in his alien
knowledge. In Caer Llyr are machines which send out certain
radiations necessary to the existence of Llyr. Those radiations
permeate the Dark World. They have caused other mutations, such as
Matholch and Edeyrn and Medea.</p>
<p>"Kill Llyr and his machines will stop. The curse of abnormal
mutations will be lifted. The shadow over this planet will be
gone."</p>
<p>"How may I kill Him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"With the Sword Called Llyr. His life is bound up with that
Sword, as a machine is dependent on its parts. I am not certain of
the reason for this, Ganelon, but Llyr is not human — now. He is
part machine and part pure energy and part something unimaginable.
But he was born of flesh, and he must maintain his contact with the
Dark World, or die. The Sword is his contact."</p>
<p>"Where is the Sword?"</p>
<p>"At Caer Llyr," Ghast Rhymi said. "Go there. By the altar, there
is a crystal pane. Don't you remember?"</p>
<p>"I remember."</p>
<p>"Break that pane. Then you will find the Sword Called Llyr."</p>
<p>He sank back. His eyes closed, then opened again.</p>
<p>I knelt before him and he made the Ancient Sign above me.</p>
<p>"Strange," he murmured, half to himself. "Strange that I should
send a man to battle again, as I sent so many, long ago."</p>
<p>The white head bent forward. Snowy beard lay upon the snowy
robe.</p>
<p>"For the sake of a wind that blew from Ireland," the old man
whispered.</p>
<p>Through the open windows a breath of air drifted, gently
ruffling the white ringlets of hair and beard… .</p>
<p>The winds of the Dark World stirred in the silent room, paused —
and were gone!</p>
<p>Now, indeed, I stood alone… .</p>
<p>From Ghast Rhymi's chamber I went down the tower steps and into
the courtyard.</p>
<p>The battle was nearly over. Scarcely a score of the Castle's
defenders were still on their feet. Around them Lorryn's pack
ravened and yelled. Back to back, grimly silent, the dead-eyed
guardsmen wove their blades in a steel mesh that momentarily held
at bay their attackers.</p>
<p>There was no time to be wasted here. I caught sight of Lorryn's
scarred face and made for him. He showed me his teeth in a
triumphant grin.</p>
<p>"We have them, Bond."</p>
<p>"It took you long enough," I said. "These dogs must be slain
quickly!" I caught a sword from a nearby woodsman.</p>
<p>Power flowed up the blade and into the hilt — into me.</p>
<p>I plunged into the thick of the battle. The foresters made way
for me. Beside me Lorryn laughed quietly.</p>
<p>Then I came face to face with a guardsman. His blade swung up in
thrust and parry, and I twisted aside, so that his steel sang
harmlessly through the air. My sword-point leaped like a striking
snake for his throat. The shock of metal grating on bone jarred my
wrist.</p>
<p>I tore the weapon free and glimpsed Lorryn, still grinning,
engaging another of the guardsmen.</p>
<p>"Kill them!" I shouted. "Kill them!"</p>
<p>I did not wait for response. I went forward against the
blind-eyed soldiers of Medea, slashing, striking, thrusting, as
though these men were the Coven, my enemies! I hated each blankly
staring face. Red tides of rage began to surge up, narrowing my
vision and clouding my mind with hot mists.</p>
<p>For a few moments, I was drunk with the lust for killing.</p>
<p>Lorryn's hands gripped my shoulders. His voice came.</p>
<p>"Bond! <em>Bond!"</em></p>
<p>The fogs were swept away. I stared around. Not one of the
guardsmen was left alive. Bloody, hacked corpses lay sprawled on
the gray flagstone of the courtyard. The woodsmen, panting hard,
were wiping their blades clean.</p>
<p>"Did any escape to carry warning to Caer Secaire?" I asked.</p>
<p>Despite his perpetual scarred grin, Lorryn looked troubled.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure. I don't think so, but the place is a
rabbit-warren."</p>
<p>"The harm's done then," I said. "We hadn't enough men to throw a
cordon around the Castle."</p>
<p>He grimaced. "Warned or not, what's the odds? We can slay the
Covenanters as we killed their guards."</p>
<p>"We ride to Caer Llyr," I said, watching him.</p>
<p>I saw the shadow of fear in the cold gray eyes. Lorryn rubbed
his grizzled beard and scowled.</p>
<p>"I don't understand. Why?"</p>
<p>"To kill Llyr."</p>
<p>Amazement battled with ancient superstitious terror in his face.
His gaze searched mine and apparently read the answer he
wanted.</p>
<p>"To kill — <em>that!"</em></p>
<p>I nodded. "I've seen Ghast Rhymi. He told me the way."</p>
<p>The men around us were watching and listening. Lorryn
hesitated.</p>
<p>"We didn't bargain for this," he said. "Yet by the gods! To kill
<em>Llyr!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly he sprang into action, shouting orders. Swords were
sheathed. Men ran to untether the mounts. Within minutes we were in
our saddles, riding out from the courtyard, the shadow of the
Castle falling heavily upon us till the moon lifted above the
tallest tower.</p>
<p>I rose in my stirrups and looked back. Up there, dead, sat
Ghasti Rhymi, first of the coven to die by my hand. I had killed
him as surely as if I had plunged steel into his heart.</p>
<p>I dropped back into the saddle, pressing heels into my horse's
flanks. He bolted forward. Lorryn urged his steed level with me.
Behind us the woodsmen strung out in a long uneven line as we
galloped across the low hills toward the distant mountains. It
would be dawn before we could reach Caer Llyr. And there was no
time to waste.</p>
<p>Medea and Edeyrn and Matholch! The names of the three beat like
muffled drums in my brain. Traitors to me, Medea no less than the
others, for had she not bent before the wills of Edeyrn and
Matholch, had she not been willing to sacrifice me? Death I would
give Edeyrn and the wolfling. Medea I might let live, but only as
my slave, nothing more.</p>
<p>With Ghast Rhymi dead, I was leader of the Coven! In the old
man's tower, sentimental weakness had nearly betrayed me. The
weakness of Edward Bond, I thought. His memories had watered my
will and diluted my power.</p>
<p>Now I no longer needed his memories. At my side swung the
Crystal Mask and the Wand of Power. I knew how to get the Sword
Called Llyr. It was Ganelon and not the weakling Edward Bond, who
would make himself master of the Dark World.</p>
<p>Briefly I wondered where Bond was now. When Medea had brought me
through the Need-fire to the Dark World, Edward Bond, at that same
moment, must have returned to Earth. I smiled ironically, imagining
the surprise that must have been his. Perhaps he had tried, and was
still trying, to get back to the Dark World. But without Freydis to
aid him, his attempts would be useless. Freydis was helping me now,
not Bond.</p>
<p>And Bond would stay on Earth! The substitution would not occur
again if I could help it. And I <em>could</em> help it. Strong
Freydis might be, but could she stand against the man who had
killed Llyr? I did not think so.</p>
<p>I sent a sly sidewise glance at Lorryn. Fool! Aries too was
another of the same breed. Only Freydis had sense enough not to
trust me.</p>
<p>The strongest of my enemies must die first — Llyr. Then the
Coven. After that, the woodsmen would taste my power. They would
learn, that I was Ganelon, not the Earth weakling, Edward Bond!</p>
<p>I thrust the memories of Bond out of my mind. I drove them away.
I banished them utterly.</p>
<p>As Ganelon I would battle Llyr.</p>
<p>And as Ganelon I would rule the Dark World!</p>
<p>Rule — with iron and fire!</p>
