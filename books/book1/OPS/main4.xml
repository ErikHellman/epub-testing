Scarlet Witch</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>GRIPPED in my right hand I still held the sword. I cut at him
savagely by way of answer. He sprang back, glanced at me over his
shoulder, and drew his weapon. I followed his glance and saw
another green figure dodging forward among the trees. It was
smaller and slenderer — a girl, in a tunic the color of earth and
forest. Her black hair swung upon her shoulders. She was tugging at
her belt as she ran, and the face she turned to me was ugly with
hate, her teeth showing in a snarl.</p>
<p>The man before me was saying something.</p>
<p>"Edward, listen to me!" he was crying. "Even if you're Ganelon,
you remember Edward Bond! He was with us — he believed in us. Give
us a hearing before it's too late! Aries could convince you,
Edward! Come to Aries. Even if you're Ganelon, let me take you to
Aries!"</p>
<p>"It's no use, Ertu," the voice of the girl cried thinly. She was
struggling with the last of the trees, whose flexible bough-tips
still clutched to stop her. Neither of them tried now to keep their
voices down. They were shouting, and I knew they must rouse the
guards at any moment, and I wanted to kill them both myself before
anyone came to forestall me by accident. I was hungry and thirsty
for the blood of these enemies, and in that moment the name of
Edward Bond was not even a memory.</p>
<p>"Kill him, Ertu!" cried the girl. "Kill him or stand out of the
way! I know Ganelon!"</p>
<p>I looked at her and took a fresh grip on my sword. Yes, she
spoke the truth. She knew Ganelon. And Ganelon knew her, and
remembered dimly that she had reason for her hate. I had seen that
face before, contorted with fury and despair. I could not recall
when or where or why, but she looked familiar.</p>
<p>The man Ertu drew his weapon reluctantly. To him I was still at
least the image of a friend. I laughed exultantly and swung at him
again with the sword, hearing it hiss viciously through the air.
This time I drew blood. He stepped back again, lifting his weapon
so that I looked down its black barrel.</p>
<p>"Don't make me do it," he said between his teeth. "This will
pass. You have been Edward Bond — you will be again. Don't make me
kill you, Ganelon!"</p>
<p>I lifted the sword, seeing him only dimly through a ruddy haze
of anger. There was a great exultation in me. I could already see
the fountain of blood that would leap from his severed arteries
when my blade completed its swing.</p>
<p>I braced my body for the great full-armed blow!</p>
<p>And the sword came alive in my hand. It leaped and shuddered
against my fist.</p>
<p>Impossibly — in a way I cannot describe — that blow reversed
itself. All the energy I was braced to expend upon my enemy
recoiled up the sword, up my arm, crashed against my own body. A
violent explosion of pain and shock sent the garden reeling. The
earth stuck hard against my knees.</p>
<p>Mist cleared from my eyes. I was still Ganelon, but a Ganelon
dizzy from something more powerful than a blow.</p>
<p>I was kneeling on the grass, braced with one hand, shaking the
throbbing fingers of my sword-hand and staring at the sword that
lay a dozen feet away, still faintly glowing.</p>
<p>It was Matholch's doing — I knew that! I should have remembered
how little I could trust that shifting, unstable wolf-ling. I had
laid hands upon him in his tower-room — I should have known he
would have his revenge for that. Even Edward Bond — soft fool that
he was — would have been wise enough not to accept a gift from the
shape-changer.</p>
<p>There was no time now for anger at Matholch, though. I was
looking up into Ertu's eyes, and into the muzzle of his weapon, and
a look of decision grew slowly in his face as he scanned mine.</p>
<p>"Ganelon!" he said, almost whispering. "Warlock!"</p>
<p>He tilted the weapon down at me, his finger moving on the
trigger.</p>
<p>"Wait, Ertu!" cried a thin voice behind him. "Wait — let
me!"</p>
<p>I looked up, still dazed. It had all happened so quickly that
the girl was still struggling in the edge of the trees, though she
cleared them as I looked and lifted her own weapon. Behind it her
face was white and blazing with relentless hate. "Let me!" she
cried again. "He owes me this!"</p>
<p>I was helpless. I knew that even at this distance she would not
miss. I saw the glare of fury in her eyes and I saw the muzzle
waver a little as her hand shook with rage, but I knew she would
not miss me. I thought of a great many things in that instant —
confused memories of Ganelon's and of Edward Bond's surged together
through my mind.</p>
<p>Then a great hissing like a wind swept up among the trees behind
the girl. They all swayed toward her more swiftly than trees have
any right to move, stooping and straining and hissing with a
dreadful vicious avidity. Ertu shouted something inarticulate. But
I think the girl was too angry to hear or see.</p>
<p>She never knew what happened. She could only have felt the great
bone-cracking sweep of the nearest branch, reaching out for her
from the leaning tree. She fired as the blow struck her, and a
white-hot bolt ploughed up the turf at my knee, I could smell the
charring grass.</p>
<p>The girl screamed thinly once as the avid boughs writhed
together over her. The limbs threshed about her in a furious
welter, and I heard one clear and distinct snap — a sound I had
heard before, I knew, in this garden. The human spine is no more
than a twig in the grip of those mighty boughs.</p>
<p>Ertu was stunned for one brief instant. Then he whirled to me,
and this time I knew his finger would not hesitate on the
trigger.</p>
<p>But time had run out for the two woods-people. He was not fully
turned when there came a laugh, cool and amused, from behind me. I
saw loathing and hatred flash across Ertu's bronzed face, and the
weapon whirled away from me and pointed toward someone at my back.
But before he could press the trigger something like an arrow of
white light sprang over my shoulder and struck him above the
heart.</p>
<p>He dropped instantly, his mouth frozen in a snarling square, his
eyes staring.</p>
<p>I turned, getting slowly to my feet. Medea stood there smiling,
very slim and lovely in a close-fitting scarlet gown. In her hand
was a small black rod, still raised. Her purple eyes met mine.</p>
<p>"Ganelon," she murmured in an infinitely caressing voice.
"Ganelon." And still holding my gaze with hers, she clapped her
hands softly.</p>
<p>Silent, swift-moving guardsmen came and lifted the motionless
body of Ertu. They carried him away. The trees stirred, whispered —
and fell silent.</p>
<p>"You have remembered," Medea said. "Ganelon is ours again. Do
you remember me — Lord Ganelon?"</p>
<p>Medea, witch of Colchis! Black and white and crimson, she stood
there smiling at me, her strange loveliness stirring old, forgotten
memories in my blood. No man who had known Medea could ever forget
her wholly. Not till time ended.</p>
<p>But wait! There was something more about Medea that I must
remember. Something that made even Ganelon a little doubtful, a
little cautious. Ganelon? Was I Ganelon again? I had been wholly my
old self when the woods-people stood before me, but now I was
uncertain.</p>
<p>The memories ebbed. While the lovely witch stood smiling at me,
not guessing, all that had made me so briefly Ganelon dropped from
my mind and body like a discarded cloak. Edward Bond stood there in
my clothing, staring about the clearing and remembering with dismay
and sick revulsion what had just been happening here.</p>
<p>For a moment I turned away to hide from Medea what my face must
betray if she saw it. I felt dizzy with more than memory. The
knowledge that two identities shared my body was a thought even
more disturbing than the memory of what I had just done in the grip
of Ganelon's strong, evil will.</p>
<p>This was Ganelon's body. There could be no doubt of it now.
Somewhere on Earth Edward Bond was back in his old place, but the
patterns of his memory still overlaid my mind, so that he and I
shared a common soul, and there was no Ganelon except briefly, in
snatches, as the memories that were rightfully mine — mine? —
returned to crowd out Edward Bond.</p>
<p>I hated Ganelon. I rejected all he thought and was. My false
memories, the heritage from Edward Bond, were stronger in me than
Ganelon. I <em>was</em> Edward Bond — now!</p>
<p>Medea's caressing voice broke in upon my conflict, echoing her
question.</p>
<p>"Do you remember me, Lord Ganelon?"</p>
<p>I turned to her, feeling the bewilderment on my own face, so
that my very thoughts were blurred.</p>
<p>"My name is Bond," I told her stubbornly.</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>"You will come back," she said. "It will take time, but Ganelon
will return to us. As you see familiar things again, the life of
the Dark World, the life of the Coven, the doors of your mind will
open once more. You will remember a little more tonight, I think,
at the Sabbat." Her red smile was suddenly almost frightening.</p>
<p>"Not since I went into the Earth-world has a Sabbat been held,
and it is long past time," she went on. "For in Caer Llyr there is
one who stirs and grows hungry for his sacrifice."</p>
<p>She looked at me piercingly, the purple eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>"Do you remember Caer Llyr, Ganelon?"</p>
<p>The old sickness and horror came over me as she repeated that
cryptic name.</p>
<p>Llyr — Llyr! Darkness, and something stirring beyond a golden
window. Something too alien to touch the soil that human feet
touched, something that should never share the same life humans
lived. Touching that soil, sharing that life, it defiled them so
that they were no longer fit for humans to share. And yet, despite
my revulsion, Llyr was terribly intimate, too!</p>
<p>I knew, I remembered —</p>
<p>"I remember nothing," I told her shortly. For in that particular
moment, caution was born in me. I could not trust anyone, not even
myself. Least of all Ganelon — myself. I <em>did</em> remember, but
I must not let them know. Until I was clearer as to what they
wanted, what they threatened, I must keep this one secret which was
all the weapon I had.</p>
<p>Llyr! The thought of him — of it — crystallized that decision in
my mind. For somewhere in the murk of Ganelon's past there was a
frightening link with Llyr. I knew they were trying to push me into
that abyss of oneness with Llyr, and I sensed that even Ganelon
feared that. I must pretend to be more ignorant than I really was
until the thing grew clearer in my memory.</p>
<p>I shook my head again. "I remembered nothing." â¢</p>
<p>"Not even Medea?" she whispered, and swayed toward me. There
was-sorcery about her. My arms received that red and white softness
as if they were Ganelon's arms, not mine. But it was Edward Bond's
lips which responded to the fierce pressure of her lips.</p>
<p>Not even Medea?</p>
<p>Edward Bond or Ganelon, what was it to me then? The moment was
enough.</p>
<p>But the touch of the red witch wrought a change in Edward Bond.
It brought a sense of strangeness, of utter strangeness, to him —
to me. I held her lovely, yielding body in my arms, but something
alien and unknown stooped and hovered above me as we touched. I
surmised that she was holding herself in check — restraining a — a
demon that possessed her — a demon that fought to free itself.</p>
<p>"Ganelon!"</p>
<p>Trembling, she pressed her palms against my chest and thrust
free. Tiny droplets stood on her pale forehead.</p>
<p>"Enough!" she whispered. "You know!"</p>
<p>"What, Medea?"</p>
<p>And now stark horror stood in those purple eyes.</p>
<p>"You have forgotten!" she said. "You have forgotten me,
forgotten who I am, <em>what</em> I am!"</p>
