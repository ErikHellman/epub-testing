Self Against Self</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>Blackness and black stones were the last things I saw, before
dark oblivion closed down over me like folding wings. It was as if
Llyr's terrible resistance was all that had held me upright in the
last fierce stages of our struggle. As he fell, so fell Ganelon at
the foot of the Windowless altar.</p>
<p>How long I lay there I do not know. But slowly, slowly Caer Llyr
came back around me, and I knew I was lying prostrate upon the
altar. I sat up painfully, the dregs of exhaustion still stiffening
my body, though I knew-I must have slept, for that exhaustion was
no longer the overwhelming tide that had flooded me as I fell.</p>
<p>Beyond me, at the head of the great steep of stairs, Freydis
lay, half stretched upon the steps as if she had striven to return
to her people in the moment before collapsing. Her eyes were still
bound, and her mighty arms lay flung out upon the platform, all
strength drained from them by the fierceness of our battle.
Strangely, as she lay there, she brought back to my double-minded
memories the thought of a figure from Earth — another mighty woman
in white robes, with bandaged eyes and upraised arms, blind Justice
holding her eternal scales.</p>
<p>Faintly I smiled at the thought. In the Dark World — my world,
now — Justice was Ganelon, and not blind.</p>
<p>Freydis stirred. One hand lifted uncertainly to the cloth across
her eyes. I let her waken. Presently we must struggle again
together, Justice and I. But I did not doubt who would prevail.</p>
<p>I rose to my knees, and heard a silvery tinkling as something
slid in fragments from my shoulder. The Mask, broken when I fell.
Its crystal shards lay among those other shards which had blasted
Llyr from the Dark World when the Sword broke. I thought of the
strange blue lightnings which had wrought at last what no other
thing in the Dark World could accomplish — Llyr's destruction. And
I thought I understood.</p>
<p>He had passed too far beyond this world ever to touch it except
in the ceremonies of the Golden Window. Man, demon, god, mutation
into namelessness — whatever he had been, he had kept but one link
with the Dark World which spawned him. A link enshrined in the
Sword Called Llyr. By that talisman he could return for the
sacrifices which fed him, return for the great ceremonies of the
Sealing that had made me half his own. But only by that
talisman.</p>
<p>So it must be safely hidden to be his bridge for the returning.
And safely hidden it was. Without Ghast Rhymi's knowledge, who
could have found it? Without the strength of the great Lord Ganelon
— well, yes, and the strength of Freydis too — who could have won
close enough to the window to shatter the Sword upon the only thing
in the Dark World that could break it? Yes, Llyr had guarded his
talisman as strongly as any guard could. But vulnerable he was, to
the one man who could wield that Sword.</p>
<p>So the Sword broke, and the bridge between worlds broke, and
Llyr was gone into a chaos from which there could never be a
returning.</p>
<p>Medea, too — red witch of Colchis, lost love, drinker of life,
gone beyond recalling… .</p>
<p>For a moment I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>"Well, Ganelon?"</p>
<p>I looked up. Freydis was smiling grimly at me from beneath the
uplifted blindfold. I rose to my feet and watched in silence while
she got to hers. Triumph flooded through me in great waves of
intoxicating warmth. The world I had just wakened to was wholly
mine now, and not this woman nor any other human should balk me of
my destiny. Had I not vanquished Llyr and slain the last of the
Coven? And was I not stronger in magic than any man or woman now
who walked the Dark World? I laughed, the deep sound echoing from
the high vaults about us and rolling back in reverberant exultation
until that which had been Caer Llyr was alive with the noise of my
mirth. But Llyr was here no longer.</p>
<p>"Let this be Caer Ganelon!" I said, hearing the echo of my own
name come rolling back as if the castle itself replied.</p>
<p>"Ganelon!" I shouted. "Caer Ganelon!" I laughed to hear the
whole vast hollow repeating my name. While the echoes still rolled
I spoke to Freydis.</p>
<p>"You have a new master now, you forest people! Because you
helped me you shall be rewarded, old woman, but I am master of the
Dark World — I Ganelon!" And the walls roared back to me, "Ganelon
— Ganelon!"</p>
<p>Freydis smiled.</p>
<p>"Not so fast, Covenanter," she said calmly. "Did you think I
trusted you?"</p>
<p>I gave her a scornful smile, "What can you do to me now? Only
one thing could slay me before today — Llyr Himself. Now Llyr is
gone, and Ganelon is immortal! You have no power to touch me,
sorceress!"</p>
<p>She straightened on the step, her ageless face a little below
mine. There was a sureness in her eyes that sent the first twinge
of uneasiness into my mind. Yet what I had said was true for no one
in the Dark World could harm me, now. Yet Freydis' smile did not
waver.</p>
<p>"Once I sent you through limbo into the Earth World," she said.
"Could you stop me if I sent you there again?"</p>
<p>Relief quieted my tremor of unease.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow or the next day — yes, I could stop you. Today, no.
But I am Ganelon now, and I know the way back. I am Ganelon, and
forewarned, and I think you could not so easily send me Earthward
again, naked of memories and clothed in another man's past. I
remember and I could return. You would waste your time and mine,
Freydis. Yet try it, if you will and I warn you, I should be back
again before your spell was finished."</p>
<p>Her quiet smile did not falter. She folded her arms, hiding her
hands in the flowing sleeves. She was very sure of herself.</p>
<p>"You think you are a godling, Ganelon," she said. "You think no
mortal power can touch you now. You have forgotten one thing. As
Llyr had his weakness, as Edeyrn did, and Medea and Matholch so
have you, Covenanter. In this world there is no man to match you.
But in the Earth World there is, Lord Ganelon! In that world your
equal lives, and I mean to call him out to fight one last battle
for the freedom of the Dark World. Edward Bond could slay you,
Ganelon!"</p>
<p>I felt the blood leave my face, a little wind of chill like
Edeyrn's glance breathed over me. I <em>had</em> forgotten. Even
Llyr, by his own unimaginable hand, could have died. And I could
die by my own hand too, or by the hand of that other self who was
Edward Bond.</p>
<p>"Fool!" I said. "Dotard! Have you forgotten that Bond and I can
never stand in the same world? When I came, he vanished out of this
land, just as I must vanish if you bring him here. How can a man
and his reflection ever come hand to hand? How could he touch me,
old woman?"</p>
<p>"Easily," she smiled. "Very easily. He cannot fight you here,
nor in the Earth World. That is true. But limbo, Ganelon? Have you
forgotten limbo?"</p>
<p>Her hands came out of her sleeves. There was a rod of blinding
silver in each. Before I could stir she had brought the rods
together, crossing them before her smiling face. At the
intersection forces of tremendous power blazed into an instant's
being, forces that streamed from the poles of the world and could
touch only for the beat of a second if that world were not to be
shaken into fragments. I felt the building reel below me.</p>
<p>I felt the gateway open.</p>
<p>Here was grayness, nothing but oblivion made visible all around
me. I staggered with the suddenness of it, the shock, and the
terrible tide of anger that came surging up through my whole body
at the knowledge of Freydis' trickery. It was not to be endured,
this magicking of the Dark World's lord! I would fight my way back
and the vengeance I would wreak upon Freydis would be a lesson to
all.</p>
<p>Out of the grayness a mirror loomed before me. A mirror? I saw
my own face, bewildered, uncomprehending, staring back into my
eyes. But I was not wearing the ragged blue garments of sacrifice
which I had donned so many aeons ago in the Castle of the Coven. I
seemed to wear Earth garments, and I seemed not quite myself, not
quite Ganelon. I seemed —</p>
<p>"Edward Bond!" said the voice of Freydis behind me.</p>
<p>The reflection of myself glanced across my shoulder, and a look
of recognition and unutterable relief came over it.</p>
<p>"Freydis!" he cried, in my own voice. "Freydis, thank God! I've
tried so hard —"</p>
<p>"Wait," Freydis stopped him. "Listen. There is one last trial
before you. This man is Ganelon. He has undone all your work among
the forest people. He has slain Llyr and the Coven. There is none
in the Dark World to stay his hand if he wins his way back to it.
Only you can stop him, Edward Bond. Only you."</p>
<p>I did not wait for her to say anything more. I knew what must be
done. I lunged forward before he could speak or stir, and drove a
heavy blow into the face that might have been my own. It was a
strange thing to do. It was a hard thing. At the last moment my
muscles almost refused me, for it was as if I struck myself.</p>
<p>I saw him reel back, and my own head reeled in imagination, so
that the first blow rocked us both.</p>
<p>He caught himself a dozen feet away and stood for a moment,
unsteady on his feet, looking at me with a confusion that might
have been the mirror of my own face, for I knew there was confusion
there too.</p>
<p>Then anger flushed those bewildering, familiar features, and I
saw blood break from the corner of his mouth and trickle across his
chin. I laughed savagely. That blood, somehow, made him my enemy. I
had seen the blood of enemies, springing out in the wake of my
blows, too often to mistake him now for anything but what he was.
Myself — and my deadliest foe.</p>
<p>He dropped into a half-crouch and came for me, stooping to
protect his body from my fists. I wished fervently for a sword or a
gun. I have never cared for an equal fight, as Ganelon does not
fight for sport, but to win. But this fight must be terribly,
unbelievably equal.</p>
<p>He dodged beneath my blow, and I felt the rocking jar of what
seemed to be my own fist jolting against my cheekbone. He danced
back, light-footed, out of range.</p>
<p>Rage came snarling up in my throat. I wanted nothing of his
boxing, this game fought by rules. Ganelon fought to win! I roared
at him from the full depth of my lungs and hurled myself forward in
a crushing embrace that carried us both heavily to the gray
sponginess that was limbo's floor. My fingers sank delightfully in
his throat. I groped savagely for his eyes. He grunted with effort
and I felt his fist thud into my ribs, and felt the sharp white
pain of breaking bone.</p>
<p>So wholly was he myself, and I he, that for an instant I was not
sure whose rib had snapped beneath whose blow. Then I drew a deep
breath and sobbed it out again half finished as pain like bright
light flashed through my body, and I knew it was my own rib.</p>
<p>The knowledge maddened me. Careless of pain or caution, I drove
my fists savagely into him at blind random, feeling exultantly the
crackle of bone beneath my knuckles, the spurt of blood over my
hard-clenched hands. We strove together in a terrible locked
embrace, there upon the floor of limbo, in a nightmare that had no
real being, except for the pain shooting through me after each
breath.</p>
<p>But in a moment or two, I knew somehow, very surely, that I was
his master. And this is how I knew. He rolled half over to jab a
hard blow into my face, and before the blow began, I had blocked
it. I had <em>known.</em> He squirmed from beneath me and braced
himself to strike me again in the ribs, and before he could strike,
I had twisted sidewise away. Again I had <em>known.</em></p>
<p>For I had been Edward Bond once, in every way that matters. I
had lived in his memory and his world. And I knew Edward Bond as I
knew myself. Instinct seemed to tell me what he would do next. He
could not out-think me, and so he could not hope to out-tight me,
to whom his every thought was revealed in the moment before he
could act upon it.</p>
<p>Even in the pain of my broken rib, I laughed then. Freydis had
overreached herself at last! In smothering Ganelon under Edward
Bond's memories in the Earth World, she had given me the means to
vanquish him now! He was mine, to finish when I chose, and the Dark
World was mine, and Edward Bond's kingdom of free people was mine
too, and Edward Bond's lovely pale-haired bride, and everything
that might have been his own.</p>
<p>I laughed exultantly, and twisted in three perfectly timed
motions that blocked and overbalanced the man who was myself. Three
motions only — and then I had him across my knee, taut-stretched,
his spine pressing hard against my thigh.</p>
<p>I grinned down at him. My blood dripped into his face. I saw it
strike there, and I met his eyes, and then strangely, for one
flashing instant, I knew a fierce yearning for defeat. In that
instant, I prayed voicelessly to a nameless god that Edward Bond
might yet save himself, and Ganelon might die… .</p>
<p>I callled forth all the strength that was in me, and limbo swam
redly before my eyes and the pain of my broken rib was a lance of
white light as I drew the deep breath that was Edward Bond's
last.</p>
<p>I broke his back across, my knee.</p>
