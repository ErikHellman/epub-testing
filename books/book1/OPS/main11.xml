Harp of Satan</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>CASTLE of the Coven! How strange it looked to me as I went
striding through its halls. Familiar, yet curiously unknown, as
though I saw it through the veil of Edward Bond's transplanted
memories.</p>
<p>So long as I went rapidly, I seemed to know the way. But if I
hesitated, my conscious mind took over control, and that mind was
still clouded with artificial memories, so that I became confused
in the halls and corridors which were familiar to me when I did not
think directly of them.</p>
<p>It was as if whatever I focused on sharply receded into
unfamiliarity while everything else remained clear, until I thought
of it.</p>
<p>I strode down hallways arched overhead and paved underfoot in
bright, intricate mosaics that told legendary tales half-familiar
to me. I walked upon centaurs and satyrs whose very faces were well
known to the Ganelon half of my mind, while the Edward Bond half
wondered in vain whether such people had really lived in this
distorted world of mutations.</p>
<p>This double mind at times was a source of strength to me, and at
others a source of devouring weakness. Just now I hoped fervently
that I might meet no delays for once I lost this rushing thread of
memory which was leading me toward Ghast Rhymi, I might never find
it again. Any interruption might be fatal to my plans.</p>
<p>Ghast Rhymi, my memories told me, would be somewhere in the
highest tower of the castle. There too would be the treasure-room
where the Mask and Wand lay hidden, and hidden deeper in the
serene, untouchable thoughts of Ghast Rhymi, lay the secret of
Llyr's vulnerability.</p>
<p>These three things I must have, and the getting would not be
easy. For I knew — without clearly remembering how or by what —
that the treasure-room was guarded by Ghast Rhymi. The Coven would
not have left open to all comers that secret place where the things
that could end them lay hidden.</p>
<p>Even I, even Ganelon, had a secret thing locked in that
treasury. For no Covenanter, no warlock, no sorceress can deal in
the dark powers without creating, himself, the one instrument that
can destroy him. That is the Law.</p>
<p>There are secrets behind it which I may not speak of, but the
common one is clear. All Earth's folklore is rife with the same
legend. Powerful men and women must focus their power in an object
detached from themselves.</p>
<p>The myth of the external soul is common to all Earth races, but
the reason for it lies deep in the lore of the Dark World. This
much I can say — that there must be a balance in all things. For
every negative, a positive. We of the Coven could not build up our
power without creating a corresponding weakness somewhere, somehow,
and we must hide that weakness so cunningly that no enemy could
find it.</p>
<p>Not even the Coven knew wherein my own secret lay. I knew
Medea's, and I knew Edeyrn's only partially, and as for Matholch —
well, against him I needed only my own Covenanter strength. Ghast
Rhymi did not matter. He would not bother to fight.</p>
<p>But Llyr? Ah!</p>
<p>Somewhere the Sword lay hidden, and he who could find and use it
in that unknown way for which it was fashioned, he held the
existence of Llyr in his own hand. But there was danger. For as
Llyr's power in the Dark World was beyond imagination, so too must
be that balancing power hidden in the Sword. Even to go near it
might be fatally dangerous. To hold it in the hand — well, hold it
I must, and there was no profit in thinking about danger.</p>
<p>I went up and up, on and on.</p>
<p>I could not hear the sounds of battle. But I knew that at the
gate the Coven guards and slaves were fighting and falling, as
Lorryn's men, too, were falling. I had warned Lorryn that none must
break through his lines to warn those at Caer Secaire. I knew that
he would follow that order, despite his anxiety to come to grips
with Matholch. For the rest, there was one in the Castle who could,
without stirring, send a message to Medea. One person!</p>
<p>He had not sent that message. I knew that as I thrust through
the white curtain and came out into the tower room. The little
chamber was semicircular, walls, floor and ceiling were ivory pale.
The casement windows were shut, but Ghast Rhymi had never needed
sight to send out his vision.</p>
<p>He sat there, an old, old man, relaxed amid the cushions of his
seat, snowy hair and beard falling in curled ringlets that blended
with his white, plain robe. His hands lay upon the chair-arms, pale
as wax, so transparent that I could almost trace the course of the
thinned blood that stirred so feebly in those old veins.</p>
<p>Wick and wax had burned down. The flame of life flickered
softly, and a wind might send that flame into eternal darkness. So
sat the Ancient of Days, his blind blue gaze not seeing me, but
turned upon inward things.</p>
<p>Ganelon's memories flooded back. Ganelon had learned much from
Ghast Rhymi. Even then, the Covenanter had been old. Now the tides
of time had worn him, as the tides of the sea wear a stone till
nothing is left but a thin shell, translucent as clouded glass.</p>
<p>Within Ghast Rhymi I could see the life-fires dwindling, sunk to
embers, almost ash.</p>
<p>He did not see me. Not easily can Ghast Rhymi be drawn back
from, the deeps where his thoughts move.</p>
<p>I spoke to him, but he did not answer.</p>
<p>I went past him then, warily, toward the wall that divided the
tower-top into two halves. There was no sign of a door, but I knew
the combination. I moved my palms in an intricate pattern on the
cool surface, and a gap widened before me.</p>
<p>I crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>Here were kept the holy things of the Coven.</p>
<p>I looked upon that treasure-vault with new eyes, clearer because
of Edward Bond's memories. That lens, burning with dull amber
lights there in its hollowed place in the wall — I had never
wondered much about it before. It killed. But memories of
Earth-science told me why. It was not magic, but an instantaneous
drainage of the electrical energy of the brain. And that conical
black device — that, killed, too. It could shake a man to pieces,
by shuttling his life-force back and forth so rapidly between
artificial cathode and anode that living flesh could not stand the
strain. Alternating current, with variations!</p>
<p>But these weapons did not interest me now. I sought other loot.
There was no death-traps to beware of, for none but the Coven knew
the way to enter this treasure-room, or its location, or even that
it existed, save in legends. And no slave or guard would have dared
to enter Ghast Rhymi's tower.</p>
<p>My gaze passed over a sword, but not the one I needed; a
burnished shield; a harp, set with an intricate array of manual
controls. I knew that harp. Earth has legends of it — the harp of
Orpheus, that could bring back the dead from Hades. Human hands
could not play it. But I was not quite ready for the harp, yet.</p>
<p>What I wanted lay on a shelf, sealed in its cylindrical case. I
broke open the seals and took out the thin black rod with its
hand-grip.</p>
<p>The Wand of Power. The Wand that could tap the electromagnetic
force of a planet. So could other wands of this type — but this was
the only one without the safety-device that limited its power. It
was dangerous to use.</p>
<p>In another case I found the Crystal Mask — a curved, transparent
plate that shielded my eyes like a domino mask of glass. This mask
would shield one from Edeyrn.</p>
<p>I searched further. But of the Sword of Llyr I could find no
trace.</p>
<p>Time did not lag. I heard nothing of the noise of battle, but I
knew that the battle went on, and I knew, too, that sooner or later
the Coven would return to the Castle. Well, I could fight the Coven
now, but I could not fight Llyr. I dared not risk the issue till I
had made sure.</p>
<p>In the door of the vault I stood, staring at Ghast Rhymi's
silvery head. Whatever guardian thought he kept here, knew I had a
right to the treasure room. He made no motion. His thoughts moved
far out in unimaginable abysses, nor could they be easily drawn
back. And it was impossible to put pressure on Ghast Rhymi. He had
the perfect answer. He could die.</p>
<p>Well, I too had an answer!</p>
<p>I went back to the vault and lifted the harp. I carried it out
and set it down before the old man. No life showed in his blue
stare.</p>
<p>I went to the windows and flung them open. Then I returned,
dropping to the cushions beside the harp, and lightly touched its
intricate controls.</p>
<p>That harp had been in the Earth-world, or others like it.
Legends know its singing strings, as legends tell of mystic swords.
There was the lyre of Orpheus, strong with power, that Jupiter
placed amid the stars. There was the harp of Gwydion of Britain,
that charmed the souls of men. And the harp of Alfred, that helped
to crush Daneland. There was David's harp that he played before
Saul.</p>
<p>Power rests in music. No man today can say what sound broke the
walls of Jericho, but once men knew.</p>
<p>Here in the Dark World this harp had its legends among the
common folk. Men said that a demon played it, that the
<em>airy</em> fingers of elemental spirits plucked at its strings.
Well, in a way they were right.</p>
<p>For an incredible perfection of science had created this harp.
It was a machine. Sonic, sub-sonic, and pure vibration to match the
thought-waves emitted by the brain blended into a whole that was
part hypnosis and part electric magnetism. The brain is a colloid,
a machine, and any machine can be controlled.</p>
<p>And the harp of power could find the key to a mind, and lay
bonds upon that mind.</p>
<p>Through the open windows, faintly from below, I heard the clash
of swords and the dim shouts of fighting men. But these sounds did
not touch Ghast Rhymi. He was lost on the plane of pure
abstraction, thinking his ancient, deep thoughts.</p>
<p>My fingers touched the controls of the harp, awkwardly at first,
then with more ease as manual dexterity came back with memory.</p>
<p>The sigh of a plucked string whispered through the white room.
The murmuring of minor notes, in a low, dreamily distant key. And
as the machine found the patterns of Ghast Rhymi's mind, under my
hands the harp quickened into breathing life.</p>
<p>The soul of Ghast Rhymi — translated into terms of pure
music!</p>
<p>Shrill and ear-piercing a single note sang.' Higher and higher
it mounted, fading into inaudibility. Deep down a roaring, windy
noise began, rising and swelling into the demon-haunted shout of a
gale. Rivers of air poured their music into the threnody.</p>
<p>High — high — cold and pure and white as the snowy summit of a
great mountain, that single thin note sang and sang again.</p>
<p>Louder grew the great winds. Rippling arpeggios raced through
the rising torrent of the sorcerous music.</p>
<p>Thunder of riven rocks — shrill screaming of earthquake-shaken
lands — yelling of a deluge that poured down upon tossing
forests.</p>
<p>A heavy humming note, hollow and unearthly, and I saw the gulfs
between the worlds where the empty night of space makes a trackless
desert.</p>
<p>And suddenly, incongruously, a gay lilting tune, with an
infectious rocking rhythm, that brought to my mind bright colors
and sunlit streams and fields.</p>
<p>Ghast Rhymi stirred.</p>
<p>For an instant awareness came back into his blue eyes. He saw
me.</p>
<p>And I saw the life-fires sink within that frail, ancient
body.</p>
<p>I knew that he was dying — that I had troubled his long peace —
that he had relinquished his casual hold upon life.</p>
<p>I drew the harp toward me. I touched the controls.</p>
<p>Ghast Rhymi sat before me, dead, the faintest possible spark
fading within that old brain.</p>
<p>I sent the sorcerous spell of the harp blowing like a mighty
wind upon the dying embers of Ghast Rhymi's life.</p>
<p>As Orpheus drew back the dead Eurydice from Pluto's realm, so I
cast my net of music, snared the soul of Ghast Rhymi, drew him back
from death!</p>
<p>He straggled at first, I felt his mind turn and writhe, trying
to escape, but the harp had already found the key to his mind, and
it would not let him go. Inexorably it drew him.</p>
<p>The ember flickered — faded — brightened again.</p>
<p>Louder sang the strings. Deeper roared the tumult of shaking
waters.</p>
<p>Higher the white, shrill note, pure as a star's icy light,
leaped and ever rose.</p>
<p>Roaring, racing, sweet with honey-musk, perfumed with
flower-scent and ambergris, blazing with color, opal and blood-ruby
and amethyst-blue, that mighty tapestry of color rippled and shook
like a visible web of magic through the room.</p>
<p>The web reached out.</p>
<p>Swept around Ghast Rhymi like a fowler's snare!</p>
<p>Back in those faded blue eyes the light of awareness grew. He
had stopped struggling. He had given up the fight. It was easier to
come back to life — to let me question him — than to battle the
singing strings that could cage a man's very soul.</p>
<p>Under the white beard the old man's lips moved.</p>
<p>"Ganelon," he said. "I knew — when the harp sang — who played
it. Well, ask your questions. And then let me die. I would not live
in the days that are coming now. But you will live, Ganelon — and
yet you will die too. That much I have read in the future."</p>
<p>The hoary head bent slowly. For an instant Ghast Rhymi listened
— and I listened too.</p>
<p>The last, achingly sweet notes of the harp died upon the
trembling air.</p>
<p>Through the open windows came the muted clash of sword and the
wordless shriek of a dying man.</p>
