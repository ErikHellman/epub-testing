The Ride to Caer Secaire</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>LATER, in the apartments that had been Ganelon's, I waited for
the hour of Sabbat. And as I waited, I paced the floor restlessly.
Ganelon's feet, pacing Ganelon's floor. But the man who walked here
was Edward Bond. Amazing, I thought, how the false memory-patterns
of another person, impressed upon Ganelon's clean-sponged brain,
had changed him from himself to — me.</p>
<p>I wondered if I would ever be sure again which personality was
myself. I hated and distrusted Ganelon, now. But I knew how easily
the old self slipped back, in which I would despise Edward
Bond.</p>
<p>And yet to save myself, I must call back Ganelon's memories. I
must know more than those around me guessed I knew, or I thought
Ganelon and Bond together might be lost. Medea would tell me
nothing. Edeyrn would tell me nothing. Matholch might tell me much,
but he would be lying.</p>
<p>I scarcely dared go with them to this Sabbat, which I thought
would be the Sabbat of Llyr, because of that strange and terrible
link between Llyr and myself. There would be sacrifices.</p>
<p>How could I be sure I, myself, was not destined for the altar
before that — that golden window?</p>
<p>Then, for a brief but timeless moment Ganelon came back,
remembering fragmentary things that flitted through my mind too
swiftly to take shape. I caught only terror — terror and revulsion
and a hideous, hopeless longing… .</p>
<p>Dared I attend the Sabbat?</p>
<p>But I dared not fail to attend, for if I refused I must admit I
knew more about what threatened Ganelon than Edward Bond should
know. And my only frail weapon against them now was what little I
recalled that was secret from them. I must go. Even if the altar
waited me, I must go.</p>
<p>There were the woodspeople. They were outlaws, hunted through
the. forests by Coven soldiers. Capture meant enslavement — I
remembered the look of still horror in the eyes of those living
dead men who were Medea's servants. As Edward Bond, I pitied them,
wondered if I could do anything to save them from the Coven. The
real Edward Bond had been living among them for a year and a half,
organizing resistance, fighting the Coven. On Earth, I knew, he
must be raging helplessly now, haunted by the knowledge of work
unfinished and friends abandoned to the mercies of dark magic.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should seek the woodspeople out. Among them, at least,
I would be safe while my memories returned. But when they returned
— why, men Ganelon would rage, running amuck among them, mad with
his own fury and arrogance. Dared I subject the woodspeople to the
danger that would be the Lord Ganelon when Ganelon's memories came
back? Dared I subject myself to their vengeance, for they would be
many against one?</p>
<p>I could not go and I could not stay. There was safety nowhere
for the Edward Bond who might become Ganelon at any moment. There
was danger everywhere. From the rebel woods-people, from every
member of this Coven.</p>
<p>It might come through the wild and mocking Matholch.</p>
<p>Or through Edeyrn, who had watched me unseen with her chilling
gaze in the shadows of her cowl.</p>
<p>Through Ghast Rhymi, whoever <em>he</em> was. Through Aries, or
through the red witch!</p>
<p>Yes, most of all, I thought, through Medea — Medea, whom I
loved!</p>
<p>At dusk, two maidens — helot-servants — came, bringing food and
a change of garments. I ate hurriedly, dressed in the plain,
fine-textured tunic and shorts, and drew about me the royal blue
cloak they had carried. A mask of golden cloth I dangled
undecidedly, until one of the maidens spoke:</p>
<p>"We are to guide you when you are ready, Lord," she reminded
me.</p>
<p>"I'm ready now," I said, and followed the pair.</p>
<p>A pale, concealed lighting system of some sort made the hallways
bright. I was taken to Medea's apartment, with its singing fountain
under the high dome. The red witch was there breathtakingly lovely
in a clinging robe of pure white. Above the robe her naked
shoulders gleamed smoothly. She wore a scarlet cloak. I wore a blue
one.</p>
<p>The helots slipped away. Medea smiled at me, but I noticed a
wire-taut tenseness about her, betrayingly visible at the corners
of her lips and in her eyes. A pulse of expectation seemed to beat
out from her.</p>
<p>"Are you ready, Ganelon?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," I said. "It depends, I suppose. Don't forget
that my memory's gone."</p>
<p>"It may return tonight, some of it anyway," she said.</p>
<p>"But you will take no part in the ritual, at least until after
the sacrifice. It will be better if you merely watch. Since you do
not remember the rites, you'd best leave those to the rest of the
Coven."</p>
<p>"Matholch?"</p>
<p>"And Edeyrn," Medea said. "Ghast Rhymi will not come. He never
leaves this castle, nor will he unless the need is very great. He
is old, too-old."</p>
<p>I frowned at the red witch. "Where are we going?" I asked.</p>
<p>"To Caer Secaire. I told you there had been no sacrifice since I
went to Earth-world to search for you. It is past time."</p>
<p>"What am I supposed to do?"</p>
<p>She put out a slender hand and touched mine.</p>
<p>"Nothing, till the moment comes. You will know then. But
meantime you must watch — no more than that. Put on your mask
now."</p>
<p>She slipped on a small black mask that left the lower half of
her face visible.</p>
<p>I donned the golden mask. I followed Medea to a curtained
archway, and through it.</p>
<p>We were in a courtyard. Two horses stood waiting, held by
grooms. Medea mounted one and I the other.</p>
<p>Overhead the sky had darkened. A huge door lifted in the wall.
Beyond, a roadway stretched toward the distant forest.</p>
<p>The somber, angry disc of the red sun, swollen and burning with
a dull fire, touched the crest of the mountain barrier.</p>
<p>Swiftly it sank. Darkness came across the sky with a swooping
rush. A million points of white light became visible. In the faint
starshine Medea's face was ghost-pale.</p>
<p>Through the near-darkness her eyes glowed.</p>
<p>Faintly, and from far away, I heard a thin, trumpeting call. It
was repeated.</p>
<p>Then silence — and a whispering that rose to a rhythmic thudding
of shod hoofs.</p>
<p>Past us moved a figure, a helot guardsman, unmasked, unspeaking,
his gaze turned to the waiting gateway.</p>
<p>Then another — and another. Until three score of soldiers had
gone past, and after them nearly three score of maidens — the
slave-girls.</p>
<p>On a light, swift-looking roan stallion Matholch came by,
stealing a glance at me from his yellow eyes. A cloak of forest
green swirled from his shoulders.</p>
<p>Behind him, the tiny form of Edeyrn, on a pony suited to her
smallness. She was still cowled, her face hidden, but she now wore
a cloak of purest yellow.</p>
<p>Medea nodded at me. We touched our heels to the horses' flanks
and took our places in the column. Behind us other figures rode,
but I could not see them clearly. It was too dark.</p>
<p>Through the gateway in the wall we went, still in silence save
for the clopping of hoofs. We rode across the plain. The edges of
the forest reached out toward us and swallowed us.</p>
<p>I glanced behind. An enormous bulk against the sky showed the
castle I had left.</p>
<p>We rode under heavy, drooping branches. These were not the black
trees of Medea's garden, but they were not normal either. I could
not tell why an indefinable sense of strangeness reached out at me
from the dun shadows above and around us.</p>
<p>After a long time the ground dipped at our feet, and we saw
below us the road's end. The moon had risen belatedly. By its
yellow glare there materialized from the deep valley below us a
sort of tower, a dark, windowless structure almost Gothic in plan,
as though it had thrust itself from the black earth, from the dark
grove of ancient and alien trees.</p>
<p>Caer Secaire!</p>
<p>I had been here before. Ganelon of the Dark World knew this spot
well. But I did not know it; I sensed only that unpleasant
familiarity, the <em>deja vu</em> phenomenon, known to all
psychologists, coupled with a curious depersonalization, as though
my own body, my mind, my very soul, felt altered and strange.</p>
<p>Caer Secaire. Secaire? Somewhere, in my studies, I had
encountered that name. An ancient rite, in — in Gascony, that was
it!</p>
<p>The Mass of Saint Secaire!</p>
<p>And the man for whom that Black Mass is said — dies. That, too,
I remembered. Was the Mass to be said for Ganelon tonight?</p>
<p>This was not the Place of Llyr. Somehow I knew that. Caer Llyr
was elsewhere and otherwise, not a temple, not a place visited by
worshipers. But here in Caer Secaire, as in other temples
throughout the Dark Land, Llyr might be summoned to his feasting,
and, summoned, would come.</p>
<p>Would Ganelon be his feast tonight? I clenched the reins with
nervous hands. There was some tension in the air that I could not
quite understand. Medea was calm beside me. Edeyrn was always calm.
Matholch, I could swear, had nothing to take the place of nerves.
Yet in the night there was tension, as if it breathed upon us from
the dark trees along the roadside.</p>
<p>Before us, in a silent, submissive flock, the soldiers and the
slave-girls went. Some of the soldiers were armed. They seemed to
be herding the rest, their movements mechanical, as if whatever had
once made them free-willed humans was now asleep. I knew without
being told the purpose for which those men and maidens were being
driven toward Caer Secaire. But not even these voiceless mindless
victims were tense. They went blindly to their doom. No, the
tension came from the dark around us.</p>
<p>Someone, something, waiting in the night!</p>
