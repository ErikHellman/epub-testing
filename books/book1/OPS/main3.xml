Matholch — and Medea</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>UP TO now the true wonder of the situation had not really
touched me yet. The anaesthesia of shock had dulled me. As a
soldier — caught in the white light of a flare dropped from an
overhead plane — freezes into immobility, so my mind still remained
passive. Only superficial thoughts were moving there, as though, by
concentration on immediate needs, I could eliminate the incredible
fact that I was not on the familiar, solid ground of Earth.</p>
<p>But it was more than this. There was a curious, indefinable
familiarity about these groined, pale-walled halls through which I
strode beside Matholch, as there had been a queer familiarity about
the twilit landscape stretching to forested distance beneath the
window of my room.</p>
<p>Edeyrn — Medea — the Coven.</p>
<p>The names had significance, like words in a language I had once
known well, but had forgotten.</p>
<p>The half-loping, swift walk of Matholch, the easy swing of his
muscular shoulders, the snarling smile on his red-bearded lips —
these were not new to me.</p>
<p>He watched me furtively out of his yellow eyes. Once we paused
before a red-figured drapery, and Matholch, hesitating, thrust the
curtain aside and gestured me forward.</p>
<p>I took one step — and stopped. I looked at him.</p>
<p>He nodded as though satisfied. Yet there was still a question in
his face.</p>
<p>"So you remember a little, eh? Enough to know that this isn't
the way to Medea. However, come along, for a moment. I want to talk
to you."</p>
<p>As I followed him up a winding stair, I suddenly realized that
he had not spoken in English. But I had understood him, as I had
understood Edeyrn and Medea.</p>
<p>Ganelon?</p>
<p>We were in a tower room, walled with transparent panes. There
was a smoky, sour odor in the <em>air,</em> and gray tendrils
coiled up from a brazier set in a tripod in the middle of the
chamber. Matholch gestured me to one of the couches by the windows.
He dropped carelessly beside me.</p>
<p>"I wonder how much you remember," he said.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"Not much. Enough not to be too — trusting."</p>
<p>"The artificial Earth-memories are still strong, then. Ghast
Rhymi said you would remember eventually, but that it would take
time. The false writing on the slate of your mind will fade, and
the old, true memories will come back. After a while."</p>
<p>Like a palimpsest, I thought — manuscript with two writings upon
its parchment. But Ganelon was still a stranger; I was still Edward
Bond.</p>
<p>"I wonder," Matholch said slowly, staring at me. "You spent much
time exiled. I wonder if you have changed, basically. Always before
— you hated me, Ganelon. Do you hate me now?"</p>
<p>"No," I said. "At least, I don't know. I think I distrust
you."</p>
<p>"You have reason. If you remember at all. We have always been
enemies, Ganelon, though bound together by the needs and laws of
the Coven. I wonder if we need be enemies any longer?"</p>
<p>"It depends. I'm not anxious to make enemies — especially
here."</p>
<p>Matholch's red brows drew together.</p>
<p>"Aye, that is not Ganelon speaking! In the old days, you cared
nothing about how many enemies you made. If you have changed so
much, danger to us all may result."</p>
<p>"My memory is gone," I said. "I don't understand much of this.
It seems dream-like."</p>
<p>Now he sprang up and restlessly paced the room. "That's well. If
you become the old Ganelon again, we'll be enemies again. That I
know. But if Earth-exile has changed you — altered you — we may be
friends. It would be better to be friends. Medea would not like it;
I do not think Edeyrn would. As for Ghast Rhymi — " He shrugged.
"Ghast Rhymi is old — old. In all the Dark World, Ganelon, you have
the most power. Or can have. But it would mean going to Caer
Llyr."</p>
<p>Matholch stooped to look into my eyes.</p>
<p>"In the old days, you knew what that meant. You were afraid, but
you wanted the power. Once you went to Caer Llyr — to be sealed. So
there is a bond between you and Llyr — not consummated yet. But it
can be, if you wish it."</p>
<p>"What is Llyr?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Pray that you will not remember that," Matholch said. "When
Medea talks to you — beware when she speaks of Llyr. I may be
friend of yours or enemy, Ganelon, but for my own sake, for the
sake of the Dark World — even for the sake of the rebels — I warn
you: do not go to Caer Llyr. No matter what Medea asks. Or
promises. At least be wary till you have your memories back."</p>
<p>"What is Llyr?" I said again.</p>
<p>Matholch swung around, his back to me. "Ghast Rhymi knows, I
think. I do not. Nor do I want to. Llyr is — is evil — and is
hungry, always. But what feeds his appetite is — is — " He
stopped.</p>
<p>"You have forgotten," he went on after a while. "One thing I
wonder. Have you forgotten how to summon Llyr?"</p>
<p>I did not answer. There was a darkness in my mind, an ebon gate
against which my questioning thoughts probed vainly. Llyr —
Llyr?</p>
<p>Matholch cast a handful of powdery substance into the glowing
brazier.</p>
<p>"Can you summon Llyr?" he asked again his voice soft. "Answer,
Ganelon. Can you?"</p>
<p>The sour smoke-stench grew stronger. The darkness in my head
sprang apart, riven, as though a gateway had opened in the shadow.
I — recognized that deadly perfume.</p>
<p>I stood up, glaring at Matholch. I took two steps, thrust out my
sandaled foot, and overturned the brazier. Embers scattered on the
stone floor. The red-beard turned a startled face to me.</p>
<p>I reached out, gripped Matholch's tunic, and shook him till his
teeth rattled together. Hot fury filled me — and something
more.</p>
<p>That Matholch should try his tricks on me!</p>
<p>A stranger had my tongue. I heard myself speaking.</p>
<p>"Save your spells for the slaves and helots," I snarled. "I tell
you what I wish to tell you — no more than that! Burn your filthy
herbs elsewhere, not in my presence!"</p>
<p>Red-bearded jaw jutted. Yellow eyes flamed. Matholch's face
altered, flesh flowing like water, dimly seen in the smoke-clouds
that poured up from the scattered embers.</p>
<p>Yellow tusks threatened me through the gray mists.</p>
<p>The shape-changer made a wordless noise in his throat — the
guttural sound a beast might make. Wolf-cry! A wolf mask glared
into mine!</p>
<p>The smoke swam away. The illusion — illusion? — was gone.
Matholch, his face relaxing from its snarling lines, pulled gently
free from my grip.</p>
<p>"You — startled me, Lord Ganelon," he said smoothly. "But I
think that I have had a question answered, whether or not these
herbs — " He nodded toward the overturned brazier. " — had anything
to do with it."</p>
<p>I turned toward the doorway.</p>
<p>"Wait," Matholch said. "I took something from you, a while
ago."</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>The red-beard came toward me, holding out a weapon — a bared
sword.</p>
<p>"I took this from you when we passed through the Need-fire," he
said. "It is yours."</p>
<p>I accepted the blade.</p>
<p>Again I moved toward the curtained archway.</p>
<p>Behind me Matholch spoke.</p>
<p>"We are not enemies yet, Ganelon," he said gently. "And if you
are wise, you will not forget my warning. Do not go to Caer
Llyr."</p>
<p>I went out. Holding the sword, I hurried down the winding
stairway. My feet found their path without conscious guidance. The
— intruder — in my brain was still strong. A palimpsest. And the
blurred, erased writing was becoming visible, as though treated
with some strong chemical.</p>
<p>The writing that was my lost memory.</p>
<p>The castle — how did I know it was a castle? — was a labyrinth.
Twice I passed silent soldiers standing guard, with a familiar
shadow of fear in their eyes — a shadow that, I thought, deepened
as they saw me.</p>
<p>I went on, hurrying along a pale-amber hallway. I brushed aside
a golden curtain and stepped into an oval room, dome-ceilinged,
walled with pale, silken draperies. A fountain spurted, its spray
cool on my cheek. Across the chamber, an archway showed the
outlines of leafy branches beyond.</p>
<p>I went on through the arch. I stepped out into a walled garden.
A garden of exotic flowers and bizarre trees.</p>
<p>The blooms were a riot of patternless color, like glowing jewels
against the dark earth. Ruby and amethyst, crystal-clear and milky
white, silver and gold and emerald, the flowers made a motionless
carpet. But the trees were not motionless.</p>
<p>Twisted and gnarled as oaks, their black boles and branches were
veiled by a luxuriant cloud of leafage, virulent green.</p>
<p>A stir of movement rippled through that green curtain. The trees
roused to awareness.</p>
<p>I saw the black branches twist and writhe slowly —</p>
<p>Satisfied, their vigilance relaxed. They were motionless again.
They — knew me.</p>
<p>Beyond that evil orchard the dark sky made the glowing ember of
the sun more brilliant by contrast.</p>
<p>The trees stirred again.</p>
<p>Ripples of unrest shook the green. A serpentine limb, training a
veil of leaves, lashed out — struck — whipped back into place.</p>
<p>Where it had been a darting shape ran forward, ducking and
twisting — as the guardian trees struck savagely at it.</p>
<p>A man, in a tight-fitting suit of earth-brown and forest-green,
came running toward me, his feet trampling the jewel-flowers. His
hard, reckless face was alight with excitement and a kind of
triumph. He was empty-handed, but a pistol-like weapon of some sort
swung at his belt.</p>
<p>"Edward!" he said urgently, yet keeping his voice low. "Edward
Bond!"</p>
<p>I knew him. Or I knew him for what he was. I had seen dodging,
furtive, green-clad figures like his before, and an anger already
familiar surged over me at the very sight of him.</p>
<p>Enemy, upstart! One of the many who had dared work their magic
upon the great Lord Ganelon.</p>
<p>I felt the heat of rage suffuse my face, and the blood rang in
my ears with this unfamiliar, yet well-known fury. My body
stiffened in the posture of Ganelon — shoulders back, lip curled,
chin high. I heard myself curse the fellow in a voice that was
choked and a language I scarcely remembered. And I saw him draw
back, disbelief vivid upon his face. His hand dropped to his
belt.</p>
<p>"Ganelon?" he faltered, his eyes narrow as they searched mine.
"Edward, are you with us or are you Ganelon again?"</p>
