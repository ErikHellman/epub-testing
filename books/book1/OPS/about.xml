<p>Henry Kuttner (April 7, 1915â€“February 4, 1958) was a science
fiction author born in Los Angeles, California. As a young man he
worked for a literary agency before selling his first story, "The
Graveyard Rats", to Weird Tales in 1936. Kuttner was known for his
literary prose and worked in close collaboration with his wife, C.
L. Moore. They met through their association with the "Lovecraft
Circle", a group of writers and fans who corresponded with H. P.
Lovecraft. Their work together spanned the 1940s and 1950s and most
of the work was credited to pseudonyms, mainly Lewis Padgett and
Lawrence O'Donnell. Both freely admitted that one reason they
worked so much together was because his page rate was higher than
hers. In fact, several people have written or said that she wrote
three stories which were published under his name. "Clash by Night"
and The Portal in the Picture, also known as Beyond Earth's Gates,
have both been alleged to have been written by her. L. Sprague de
Camp, who knew Kuttner and Moore well, has stated that their
collaboration was so intensive that, after a story was completed,
it was often impossible for either Kuttner or Moore to recall who
had written which portions. According to de Camp, it was typical
for either partner to break off from a story in mid-paragraph or
even mid-sentence, with the latest page of the manuscript still in
the typewriter. The other spouse would routinely continue the story
where the first had left off. They alternated in this manner as
many times as necessary until the story was finished. Among
Kuttner's most popular work were the Gallegher stories, published
under the Padgett name, about a man who invented robots when he was
stinking drunk, only to be completely unable to remember exactly
why he had built them after sobering up. These stories were later
collected in Robots Have No Tails. In the introduction to the
paperback reprint edition after his death, Moore stated that all
the Gallagher stories were written by Kuttner alone. In 2007, New
Line Cinema released a feature film based on the Lewis Padgett
short story "Mimsy Were the Borogoves" under the title The Last
Mimzy. In addition, The Best of Henry Kuttner was republished under
the title The Last Mimzy Stories. Source: Wikipedia</p>
