Lair of Power</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>MIRACULOUSLY the weakness that had chained me was, gone. Llyr's
strength poured through me. I unsheathed my sword and ran past
Matholch's body, ignoring Lorryn who stood motionless, staring
down. I ran to the pedestal with its blue-litten pane.</p>
<p>I gripped the sword's blade and sent the heavy hilt crashing
against the glass.</p>
<p>There was a tinkling of pizzicato notes, a singing of thin
goblin laughter. The shards fell clashing at my feet.</p>
<p>At my feet also dropped a sword. A sword of crystal, nearly five
feet long — pommel and guard and blade all of clearest glass.</p>
<p>It had been part of the window. For within the hollow pedestal
was nothing at all. The sword had been part of the pane, so that my
breaking the crystal had released the weapon from its camouflaged
hiding-place.</p>
<p>Along the sleek blade blue light ran. Within the crystal blue
fires burned wanly. I bent and picked up the sword. The hilt was
warm and alive.</p>
<p>The Sword Called Llyr in my left hand, the sword with blade of
steel in my right, I stood upright.</p>
<p>Paralyzing cold breathed past me.</p>
<p>I knew that cold.</p>
<p>So I did not turn. I swung the steel sword under my arm,
snatched the Crystal Mask from my belt, and donned it. I drew the
Wand of Power.</p>
<p>Only then did I turn.</p>
<p>Through the Mask queer glimmers and shiftings ran, distorting
what I saw. The properties of light were oddly altered by the Mask.
But it had its purpose. It was a filter.</p>
<p>Matholch lay motionless now. Beyond his body Medea was rising to
her feet, her dark hair disordered. Facing me stood Lorryn, a stone
man, only his eyes alive in his set, white face.</p>
<p>He was staring at Edeyrn, whose sleek dark head I saw. Her back
was toward me. The cowl had been flung back upon her shoulders.</p>
<p>Lorryn sagged down, the life going out of him. Bonelessly as
water he collapsed.</p>
<p>He lay dead.</p>
<p>Then slowly, slowly, Edeym turned.</p>
<p>She was tiny as a child, and her face was like a child's too, in
its immature roundness. But I did not see her face, for even
through the Crystal Mask burned the Gorgon's glare.</p>
<p>The blood stilled within me. A slow tide of ice crept with iron
lethargy into my brain and cold wariness engulfed me.</p>
<p>Only in the eyes of the Gorgon fire burned:</p>
<p>Deadly radiations were there, what Earth-scientists call
ectogenetic rays, but limited till now to the plant-world. Only the
mad mutation that had created Edeyrn could have brought from hell
such a nightmare trick of biology.</p>
<p>But I did not fall. I did not die. The radiations were filtered,
made harmless, by the vibration-warping properties of the Mask I
wore.</p>
<p>I lifted the Wand of Power.</p>
<p>Red fires blasted from it. Scarlet, licking tongues seared out
toward Edeyrn.</p>
<p>Lashes of flame tore at her, like crimson whips that burned and
left bloody weals on that calm child-face.</p>
<p>She drew back, the lance of her stare driving at me.</p>
<p>With her, step by step, retreated Medea. Toward the foot of the
great stairway that led to Llyr's Window.</p>
<p>The whips of fire seared across her eyes.</p>
<p>She turned and, stumbling, began to run up the stairway. Medea
paused, her arms lifted in an uncompleted gesture. But in my face
she read no softening.</p>
<p>She, too, turned, and followed Edeyrn.</p>
<p>I dropped the useless sword of steel. Wand in left hand, the
Sword Called Llyr in my right, I followed them.</p>
<p>As my foot touched the first step, a trembling vibration shook
the violet air about me. Now almost I regretted having called upon
Llyr to break Medea's spell. For Llyr was awake, watching, and
warned.</p>
<p>The pulse of Llyr muttered through the huge Caer. The golden
lightnings flamed from the Window high above.</p>
<p>Briefly two black small silhouettes showed against that amber
glow. They were Edeyrn and Medea, climbing.</p>
<p>After them I went. And at each step the way grew harder. I
seemed to walk through a thickening, invisible torrent dot was like
a wind or a wave flowing down from that shining window, striving to
tear me from my foothold, to rip the crystal sword from my
grip.</p>
<p>Up and up I went. Now the Window was a glaring blaze of yellow
fires. The lightnings crackled out incessantly, while rocking
crashes of thunder reverberated along the vaulted abysses of the
Caer. I leaned forward as though against a gale. Doggedly I fought
my way up the stair.</p>
<p>There was someone behind me.</p>
<p>I did not turn. I dared not, for fear the torrent would sweep me
from my place. I crawled up the last few steps, and came out on a
level platform of stone, a disc-shaped dais, on which stood a
ten-foot cube. Three of its sides were of black rock. The side that
faced me was a glaring blaze of amber brilliance.</p>
<p>Far below, dizzyingly far, was the floor of the Caer. Behind me
the stairway ran down to those incredible depths, and the
tremendous wind still blew upon me, pouring out from the Window,
seeking to whirl me to my death.</p>
<p>To the Window's left stood Edeyrn, to its right, Medea. And in
the Window —</p>
<p>The blazing golden clouds whirled, thickened, tossed like
storm-mists, while still the blinding flashes spurted from them.
The thunder never ceased now. But it pulsed. It rose and fell in
steady cadence, in unison with the heart-beat of Llyr.</p>
<p>Monster or mutation — human once, or half-human — Llyr had grown
in power since then. Ghast Rhymi had warned me.</p>
<p>Part machine and part pure energy and part something
unthinkable, the power of Llyr blasted through the golden clouds
upon me!</p>
<p>The Wand of Power dropped from my hand. I lifted the crystal
sword and managed one forward step. Then the helltide caught me,
and I could advance no further. I could only fight, with every bit
of my strength, against the avalanche that strove to thrust me
toward the edge of the hanging platform.</p>
<p>Louder grew the thunders. Brighter the lightnings flamed.</p>
<p>The cold stare of Edeyrn chilled me. Medea's face was inhuman
now. Yellow clouds boiled out from the Window and caught Edeyrn and
Medea in their embrace.</p>
<p>Then they rolled toward me and overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>Dimly I could see the brighter glow that marked Llyr's Window.
And two vague silhouettes, Edeyrn and Medea.</p>
<p>I strove to step forward. Instead I was borne back toward the
edge — back and back.</p>
<p>Great arms caught me about the waist. A braid of white hair
tossed by my eyes. The giant strength of Freydis stood like a wall
of iron between me and the abyss.</p>
<p>From the corner of my eye I saw that she had wound a scrap torn
from her white robe about her head, shielding her from the Gorgon's
stare. Blindly, guided by some strange instinct, the Valkyrie
thrust me forward.</p>
<p>Against us the golden clouds rolled, sentient, palpable, veined
with white lightnings and shaking with deep thunders.</p>
<p>Freydis strove silently. I bent forward like a bow, battering
against the torrent.</p>
<p>Step by step I won forward, Freydis to aid me. Ever she stood as
a bulwark against my back. I could hear her panting breath, great
gasps that ripped from her throat as she linked her strength with
mine.</p>
<p>My chest felt as though a white-hot core of iron was driven
through it. Yet I went on. Nothing existed now but that golden
brightening amid the clouds, clouds of creation, sentient with the
shaking tumult of breaking universes, worlds beyond worlds crashing
into ruin under the power of Llyr… .</p>
<p>I stood before the Window.</p>
<p>Without volition my arm swept up. I brought the Sword Called
Llyr smashing down upon Llyr's Window.</p>
<p>In my hand the sword broke.</p>
<p>It fell to tinkling fragments at my feet. The veined blue
glimmers writhed and coiled about the broken blade.</p>
<p>Were sucked into the Window.</p>
<p>Back rushed the cloud-masses. A tremendous, nearly unbearable
vibration ripped through the Caer, shaking it like a sapling. The
golden clouds were drawn through the Window.</p>
<p>With them went Edeyrn and Medea!</p>
<p>One glimpse I had of them, the brand of my fire like a red mask
across Edeyrn's eyes, Medea's face despairing and filled with a
horror beyond life, her gaze fixed on me with an imploring plea
that was infinitely terrible. Then they vanished!</p>
<p>For one instant I saw through the Window. I saw something beyond
space and time and dimension, a writhing, ravening chaos that bore
down upon Medea and Edeyrn and a golden core of light that I knew
for Llyr.</p>
<p>Once almost human, Llyr, at the end, bore no relation to
anything remotely human.</p>
<p>The grinding millstones of Chaos crushed the three!</p>
<p>The thunder died.</p>
<p>Before me stood the altar of Llyr. But it held no Window, now.
All four sides were of black, dead stone!</p>
