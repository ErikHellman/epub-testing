Call of the Red Witch</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>I COULD not sleep. The suffocating breathlessness of late summer
lay like a woollen blanket over me. Presently I went into the big
room and restlessly searched for cigarettes. My uncle's voice came
through an open doorway.</p>
<p>"All right, Ed?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I can't sleep yet. Maybe I'll read."</p>
<p>I chose a book at random, sank into a relaxer chair and switched
on a lamp. It was utterly silent. I could not even hear the faint
splashing of little waves on the lakeshore.</p>
<p>There was something I wanted —</p>
<p>A trained rifleman's hand, at need, will itch for the feeling of
smooth wood and metal. Similarly, my hand was hungry for the feel
of something — neither gun nor sword, I thought.</p>
<p>A weapon that I had used before. I could not remember what it
was. Once I glanced at the poker leaning against the fireplace, and
thought that was it; but the flash of recognition was gone
instantly.</p>
<p>The book was a popular novel. I skimmed through it rapidly. The
dim, faint, pulsing in my blood did not wane. It grew stronger,
rising from sub-sensory levels. A distant excitement seemed to be
growing deep in my mind.</p>
<p>Grimacing, I rose to return the book to its shelf. I stood there
for a moment, my glance skimming over the titles. On impulse I drew
out a volume I had not looked at for many years, the Book of Common
Prayer.</p>
<p>It fell open in my hands. A sentence blazed out from the
page.</p>
<p>I am become as it were a monster unto many.</p>
<p>I put back the book and returned to my chair. I was in no mood
for reading. The lamp overhead bothered me, and I pressed for the
switch. Instantly moonlight flooded the room — and instantly the
curious sense of expectancy was heightened, as though I had lowered
a — a barrier.</p>
<p>The sheathed sword still lay on the window-seat. I looked past
it, to the clouded sky where a golden moon shone. Faint, far away,
a glimmer showed — the Need-fire, blazing in the swampy wilderness
of the Limberlost.</p>
<p>And it called.</p>
<p>The golden square of window was hypnotic. I lay back in my
chair, half-closing my eyes, while the sense of danger moved coldly
within my brain. Sometimes before I had felt this call, summoning
me. And always before I had been able to resist.</p>
<p>This time I wavered.</p>
<p>"The lock of hair clipped from my head — had that given the
enemy power? Superstition. My logic called it that, but a deep,
inner well of conviction told me that the ancient hair-magic was
not merely mummery. Since that time in Sumatra, I had been far less
skeptical. And since then I had studied.</p>
<p>The studies were strange enough, ranging from the principles of
sympathetic magic to the wild fables of lycanthropy and demonology.
Yet I was amazingly quick at learning.</p>
<p>It was as though I took a refresher course, to remind myself of
knowledge I had once known by heart. Only one subject really
troubled me, and I continually stumbled across it, by roundabout
references.</p>
<p>And that was the Force, the entity, disguised in folklore under
such familiar names as the Black Man, Satan, Lucifer, and such
unfamiliar names as Kutchie, of the Australian Dieris, Tuna, of the
Esquimaux, the African Abonsam, and the Swiss Stratteli.</p>
<p>I did no research on the Black Man — but I did not need to.
There was a recurrent dream that I could not help identifying with
the dark force that represented evil. I would be standing before a
golden square of light, very much afraid, and yet straining toward
some consummation that I desired. And deep down within that glowing
square that would be the beginning of motion. I knew there were
certain ritual gestures to be made before the ceremony could be
begun, but it was difficult to break the paralysis that held
me.</p>
<p>A square like the moon-drenched window before me — yet not the
same.</p>
<p>For no chill essence of fear thrust itself out at me now.
Rather, the low humming I heard was soothing, gentle as a woman's
crooning voice.</p>
<p>The golden square wavered — shook — and little tendrils of
crepuscular light fingered out toward me. Ever the low humming
came, alluring and disarming.</p>
<p>Golden fingers — tentacles — they darted here and there as if
puzzled. They touched lamp, table, carpet, and drew back. They —
touched me.</p>
<p>Swiftly they leaped forward now — avid! I had time for a
momentary pulse of alarm before they wrapped me in an embrace like
golden sands of sleep. The humming grew louder. And I responded to
it.</p>
<p>As the skin of the flayed satyr Marsyas thrilled at the sound of
his native Phrygian melodies! I knew this music. I knew this —
chant!</p>
<p>Stole through the golden glow a crouching shadow — not human —
with amber eyes and a bristling mane — the shadow of a wolf.</p>
<p>It hesitated, glanced over its shoulder questioningly. And now
another shape swam into view, cowled and gowned so that nothing of
its face or body showed. But it was small — small as a child.</p>
<p>Wolf and cowled figure hung in the golden mists, watching and
waiting. The sighing murmur altered. Formed itself into syllables
and words. Words in no human tongue, but — I knew them.</p>
<p>"Ganelon! I call you, Ganelon! By the seal in your blood — hear
me!"</p>
<p>Ganelon! Surely that was my name. I knew it so well.</p>
<p>Yet who called me thus?</p>
<p>"I have called you before, but the way was not open. Now the
bridge is made. Come to me, Ganelon!"</p>
<p>A sigh.</p>
<p>The wolf glanced over a bristling shoulder, snarling. The cowled
figure bent toward me. I sensed keen eyes searching me from the
darkness of the hood, and an icy breath touched me.</p>
<p>"He has forgotten, Medea," said a sweet, high-pitched voice,
like the tone of a child.</p>
<p>Again the sigh. "Has he forgotten me? Ganelon, Ganelon! Have you
forgotten the arms of Medea, the lips of Medea?"</p>
<p>I swung,' cradled in the golden mists, half asleep.</p>
<p>"He has forgotten," the cowled figure said.</p>
<p>"Then let him come to me nevertheless. Ganelon! The Need-fire
burns. The gateway lies open to the Dark World. By fire and earth,
and darkness, I summon you! Ganelon!"</p>
<p>"He has forgotten."</p>
<p>"Bring him. We have the power, now."</p>
<p>The golden sands thickened. Flame-eyed wolf and robed shadow
swam toward me. I felt myself lifted — moving forward, not of my
own volition.</p>
<p>The window swung wide. I saw the sword, sheathed and ready. I
snatched up the weapon, but I could not resist that relentless tide
that carried me forward. Wolf and whispering shadow drifted with
me.</p>
<p>"To the Fire. Bring him to the Fire."</p>
<p>"He has forgotten, Medea."</p>
<p>"To the Fire, Edeyrn. To the Fire."</p>
<p>Twisted tree-limbs floated past me. Far ahead I saw a flicker.
It grew larger, nearer. It was the Need-fire.</p>
<p>Faster the tide bore me. Toward the fire itself —</p>
<p><em>Not to Caer Llyr!</em></p>
<p>From the depths of my mind the cryptic words spewed. Amber-eyed
wolf whirled to glare at me; cowled shadow swept in closer on the
golden stream. I felt a chill of deadly cold drive through the
curling mists.</p>
<p>"Caer Llyr," the cloaked Edeyrn whispered in the child's sweet
voice. "He remembers Caer Llyr — but does he remember Llyr?"</p>
<p>"He will remember! He has been sealed to Llyr. And, in Caer
Llyr, the Place of Llyr, he will remember."</p>
<p>The Need-fire was a towering pillar a few yards away. I fought
against the dragging tide.</p>
<p>I lifted my sword — threw the sheath away. I cut at the golden
mists that fettered me.</p>
<p>Under the ancient steel the shining fog-wraiths shuddered and
were torn apart — and drew back. There was a break in the humming
harmony; for an instant, utter silence.-</p>
<p>Then —</p>
<p>"Matholch!" the invisible whisperer cried. "Lord Matholch!"</p>
<p>The wolf crouched, fangs bared. I aimed a cut at its snarling
mask. It avoided the blow easily and sprang.</p>
<p>It caught the blade between its teeth and wrenched the hilt from
my grip.</p>
<p>The golden fogs surged back, folding me in their warm
embrace.</p>
<p>"Caer Llyr," they murmured.</p>
<p>The Need-fire roared up in a scarlet fountain.</p>
<p>"Caer Llyr!" the flames shouted.</p>
<p>And out of those fires rose — a woman!</p>
<p>Hair dark as midnight fell softly to her knees. Under level
brows she flashed one glance at me, a glance that held question and
a fierce determination. She was loveliness incarnate. Dark
loveliness.</p>
<p>Lilith. Medea, witch of Colchis!</p>
<p>And —</p>
<p>"The gateway closes," the child-voice of Edeym said.</p>
<p>The wolf, still mouthing my sword, crouched uneasily. But the
woman of the fire said no word.</p>
<p>She held out her arms to me.</p>
<p>The golden clouds thrust me forward, into those white arms.</p>
<p>Wolf and cowled shadow sprang to flank us. The humming rose to a
deep-pitched roar — a thunder as of crashing worlds.</p>
<p>"It is difficult, difficult," Medea said. "Help me, Edeyrn. Lord
Matholch."</p>
<p>The fires died. Around us was not the moonlit wilderness of the
Limberlost, but empty grayness, a featureless grayness that
stretched to infinity. Not even stars showed against that
blank.</p>
<p>And now there was fear in the voice of Edeyrn.</p>
<p>"Medea. I have not the — power. I stayed too long in the
Earth-world."</p>
<p>"Open the gate!" Medea cried. "Thrust it open but a little way,
or we stay here between the worlds forever!"</p>
<p>The wolf crouched, snarling. I felt energy pouring out of his
beast-body. His brain that was not the brain of a beast.</p>
<p>Around us the golden clouds were dissipating.</p>
<p>The grayness stole in.</p>
<p>"Ganelon," Medea said. "Ganelon! Help me!"</p>
<p>A door in my mind opened. A formless darkness stole in.</p>
<p>I felt that deadly, evil shadow creep through me, and submerge
my mind under ebon waves.</p>
<p>"He has the power," Edeyrn murmured. "He was sealed to Llyr. Let
him call on — Llyr."</p>
<p>"No. No. I dare not. Llyr?" But Medea's face was turned to me
questioningly.</p>
<p>At my feet the wolf snarled and strained, as though by sheer
brute strength it might wrench open a gateway between locked
worlds.</p>
<p>Now the black sea submerged me utterly. My thought reached out
and was repulsed by the dark horror of sheer infinity, stretched
forth again and —</p>
<p>Touched — something!</p>
<p>Llyr… Llyr!</p>
<p>"The gateway opens," Edeyrn said.</p>
<p>The gray emptiness was gone. Golden clouds thinned and vanished.
Around me, white pillars rose to a vault far, far above. We stood
on a raised dais upon which curious designs were emblazoned.</p>
<p>The tide of evil which had flowed through me had vanished.</p>
<p>But, sick with horror and self-loathing, I dropped to my knees,
one arm shielding my eyes.</p>
<p>I had called on — <em>Llyr!</em></p>
