Fire of Life</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>HOURS BEFORE we came to Caer Llyr we saw it, at first a blacker
blackness against the night sky, and slowly, gradually, deepening
into an ebon mountain as the rose-gray dawn spread behind us.</p>
<p>Our cantering shadows fell before us, to be trodden under the
horses' hoofs. Cool, fresh winds whispered — whispered of the
sacrifice at Caer Secaire, of the seeking minds of the Coven that
spied across the land.</p>
<p>But Caer Llyr loomed on the edge of darkness ahead — guarding
the night!</p>
<p>Huge the Caer was, and alien. It seemed shapeless, a Titan mound
of jumbled black rock thrown almost casually together. Yet I knew
that there was design in its strange geometry.</p>
<p>Two jet pillars, each fifty feet tall, stood like the legs of a
colossus, and between them was an unguarded portal. Only there was
mere any touch of color about the Caer.</p>
<p>A veil of flickering rainbows played lambently, like a veil
across the threshold. Opalescent and faintly glowing, the
shadow-curtain swung and quivered as though gentle winds drifted
through gossamer folds of silk.</p>
<p>Fifty feet high was that curtain and twenty feet broad.
Straddling it the ebon pillars rose. And above and beyond, towering
breathtakingly to the dawn-clouded sky, squatted the Caer, a
mountain-like structure that had never been built by man.</p>
<p>From Caer Llyr a breath of fear came coldly, scattering the
woodsmen like leaves before a gale. They broke ranks, deployed out
and drew together again as I raised my hand and Lorryn called a
command.</p>
<p>I stared around at the low hills surrounding us.</p>
<p>"Never in my memory or my father's memory have men come this
close to Caer Llyr," Lorryn said. "Except for Covenanters, of
course. Nor would the foresters follow me now, Bond. They follow
you."</p>
<p>How far would they follow? My wondering thought was cut off as a
woodsman shouted warning. He rose in his stirrups and pointed
south.</p>
<p>Over the hills, riding like demons in a dusty cloud, came
horsemen, their armor glittering in the red sunlight!</p>
<p>"So someone did escape from the Castle," I said between my
teeth. "And the Coven have been warned, after all!"</p>
<p>Lorryn grinned and shrugged. "Not many."</p>
<p>"Enough to delay us." I frowned, trying to make the best plan.
"Lorryn, stop them. If the Coven ride with then- guards, kill them
too. But hold them back from the Caer until —"</p>
<p>"Until?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'll need time. How much time I can't say.
Battling and conquering Llyr won't be the work of a moment."</p>
<p>"Nor is it the work of one man," Lorryn said doubtfully. "With
us to aid you, victory will fly at your elbow."</p>
<p>"I know the weapon against Llyr," I said. "One man can wield it.
But keep the guardsmen back, and the Covenanters too. Give me
time!"</p>
<p>"There will be no difficulty about that," Lorryn said, a flash
of excitement lighting his eyes. "For look!"</p>
<p>Angling across the hills, riding one by one into view, hotly
pursuing the armored rout, came green-clad figures, spurring their
horses forward.</p>
<p>Those figures were woodsmen's women whom we had left behind in
the valley. They were armed now, for I saw the glitter of swords.
Nor were swords their only weapons. A spiteful crack echoed, a puff
of smoke arose, and one of the guardsmen flung up his hands and
toppled from his mount.</p>
<p>Edward Bond had known how to make rifles! And the woodsfolk had
learned how to use them!</p>
<p>At the head of the woods women I noted two lithe forms, one a
slim, supple girl whose ashy-blond hair streamed behind her like a
banner. Aries.</p>
<p>And at her side, on a great white steed, rode one whose giant
form I could not mistake even from this distance. Freydis spurred
forward like a Valkyrie galloping into battle.</p>
<p>Freydis and Aries, and the women of the forest!</p>
<p>Lorryn's laugh held exultation.</p>
<p>"We have them, Bond!" he cried, his fist tightening on the rein.
"Our women at their heels, and we to strike from the flank — we'll
catch and crush them between hammer and anvil. Gods grant the
shape-changer rides there!"</p>
<p>"Then ride," I snapped. "No more talk! Ride and crush them. Hold
them back from the Caer!"</p>
<p>With that I raced my steed forward, lying low on the horse's
mane, driving like a thunderbolt toward the black mountain ahead.
Did Lorryn know how suicidal might be the mission on which I had
sent him? Matholch he might slay, and even Medea. But if Edeyrn
rode with the Coven guards, if ever she dropped the hood from her
face, neither sword nor bullet could save the woodsmen!</p>
<p>Still they would give me time. And if the woodsmen's ranks were
thinned, so much the better for me later. I would deal with Edeyrn
in my own way when the time came.</p>
<p>Ahead the black columns stood. Behind me a shouting rose, and a
crackle of rifle-fire. I looked back, but a fold of the hills hid
the combat from my eyes.</p>
<p>I sprang from the horse's back and stood before the pillars —
between them. The coruscating veil sparkled and ran like milky
water before me. Above, towering monstrously, stood the Caer, the
focus of the evil that had spread across the Dark World.</p>
<p>And in it reposed Llyr, my enemy!</p>
<p>I still had the sword I had taken from one of the woodsmen, but
I doubted if ordinary steel would be much good within the Caer.
Nevertheless I made sure the weapon was at my side as I walked
forward.</p>
<p>I stepped through the veil.</p>
<p>For twenty paces I moved forward in utter darkness. Then light
came.</p>
<p>But it was the light that beats upon a snow plain, so bright, so
glittering, that it blinds. I stood motionless, waiting. Presently
the dazzle resolved itself into flickering atoms of brightness,
weaving and darting in arabesque patterns. Not cold, no!</p>
<p>Tropical warmth beat upon me.</p>
<p>The shining atoms drove at me. They tingled upon my face and
hands. They sank like intangible things through my garments and
were absorbed by my skin. They did not lull me. Instead, my body
greedily drank that weird snowstorm of — energy? — and was in turn
energized by it.</p>
<p>Tide of life sang ever stronger in my veins.</p>
<p>I saw three gray shadows against the white. Two tall and one
slight and small as a child's shadow.</p>
<p>I knew them. I knew who cast them.</p>
<p>I heard Matholch's voice.</p>
<p>"Kill him. Kill him now."</p>
<p>And Medea's answer.</p>
<p>"No. He need not die. He must not."</p>
<p>"But he must!" Matholch snarled, and Edeyrn's sexless, thin
voice echoed his.</p>
<p>"He is dangerous, Medea. He must die, and only on Llyr's altar
can he be slain. For he is the Sealed of Llyr."</p>
<p>"He need not die," Medea said stubbornly. "If he is made
harmless — weaponless — he may live."</p>
<p>"How?" Edeym asked, and for answer the red witch stepped forward
out of the dazzling white shimmer.</p>
<p>No longer a shadow. No longer a two-dimensional grayness. She
stood before me — Medea, witch of Colchis.</p>
<p>Her dark hair fell to her knees. Her dark gaze slanted at me.
Evil she was, and alluring as Lilith.</p>
<p>I dropped my hand to sword-hilt.</p>
<p>I did <em>not. I</em> could not move. Faster swirled the darting
bright atoms, whirling about me, sinking into my body to betray
me.</p>
<p>I could not move.</p>
<p>Beyond Medea the twin shadows bent forward.</p>
<p>"The power of Llyr holds him," Edeyrn whispered. "But Ganelon is
strong, Medea. If he breaks his fetters, we are lost."</p>
<p>"By then he will have no weapons," Medea said, and smiled at
me.</p>
<p>Now indeed I knew my danger. Very easily my steel could have
bitten through Medea's soft throat, and heartily I wished it had
done so long ago. For I remembered Medea's power. The mutation that
set her apart from others. That which had caused her to be named —
vampire.</p>
<p>I remembered victims of hers that I had seen. The dead-eyed
guardsmen, the Castle slaves, hollow shells of men, the walking
dead, all soul drained from them, and most of their life-forms as
well.</p>
<p>Her arms stole around my neck. Her mouth lifted to mine.</p>
<p>In one hand she held her black wand. It touched my head, and a
gentle shock, not unpleasant, crawled along my scalp. The — the
conductor, I knew, and a gust of insane laughter shook me at the
incongruity of the weapon.</p>
<p>But there was no magic here. There was science, of a high order,
a science made possible only for those who were trained to it, or
for those who were mutants. Medea drank energy, but not through
sorcery. I had seen that wand used too often to believe that.</p>
<p>The wand opened the closed circuits of the mind and its
energies. It tapped the brain, as a copper wire can tap a generated
current.</p>
<p>Diverting the life-force to Medea!</p>
<p>The shining mist-motes swirled faster. They closed in around us,
bathing us in a swirling cloak. The gray shadowiness fell away from
Edeym and Matholch. Dun-cloaked, cowled dwarf and lean, grinning
wolfling stood there, watching.</p>
<p>Edeyrn's face I could not see, though the deadly cold crept from
beneath the cowl like an icy wind. Matholch's tongue crept out and
circled his lips. His eyes were bright with triumph and
excitement.</p>
<p>A numbing, lethargic languor was stealing over me. Against my
mouth as Medea's lips grew hotter, more ardent, as my own lips
chilled. Desperately I tried to move, to grasp my sword-hilt. I
could not.</p>
<p>Now the bright veil thinned again. Beyond Matholch and Edeyrn I
could see a vast space, so enormous that my gaze failed to pierce
its violet depths. A stairway led up to infinite heights.</p>
<p>A golden glow burned high above.</p>
<p>But behind Matholch and Edeyrn, a little to one side, stood a
curiously-carved pedestal whose front was a single pane of
transparent glass. It shone steadily with a cool blue light. What
lay within I did not know, but I recognized that crystal pane.</p>
<p>Ghast Rhymi had spoken of it. Behind it must lie the Sword
Called Llyr.</p>
<p>Faintly now — faintly — I heard Matholch's satisfied
chuckle.</p>
<p>"Ganelon, my love, do not struggle against me," Medea whispered.
"Only I can save you. When your madness passes, we will return to
the Castle."</p>
<p>Yes, for I would be no menace then. Matholch would not bother to
harm me. As a mindless, soulless thing I would return to the Castle
of the Coven as Medea's slave.</p>
<p>I, Ganelon, hereditary Lord of the Coven and the Sealed of
Llyr!</p>
<p>The golden glow high above brightened. Crooked lightnings rushed
out from it and were lost in the violet dimness.</p>
<p>My eyes found that golden light that was the Window of Llyr.</p>
<p>My mind reached out toward it.</p>
<p>My soul strained to it!</p>
<p>Witch and vampire-mutation Medea might be — or sorceress — but
she had never been sealed to Llyr. No dark power beat latently in
her blood as it beat in mine. Well I knew now that, no matter how I
might renounce my allegiance to Llyr, there yet had been a bond.
Llyr had power over me, but I could draw upon his power as
well!</p>
<p>I drew on that power now!</p>
<p>The golden window brightened. Again forked lightnings ran out
from it and were gone. A muffled, heavy drum-beat muttered from
somewhere, like the pulse of Llyr.</p>
<p>Like the heart of Llyr, stirring from sleep to waking.</p>
<p>Through me power rushed, quickening my flesh from its lethargy.
I drew on Llyr's power without measuring the cost. I saw fear flash
across Matholch's face, and Edeyrn made a quick gesture.</p>
<p>"Medea," she said.</p>
<p>But Medea had already sensed that quickening. I felt her body
quiver convulsively against mine. Avidly she pressed against me,
faster and faster she drank the energy that made me alive.</p>
<p>But the energy of Llyr poured into me! Hollow thunders roared in
the vast spaces above. The golden window blazed with dazzling
brightness. And around us now the sparkling motes of light paled,
shrank, and were gone.</p>
<p>"Kill him!" Matholch howled. "He holds Llyr!"</p>
<p>He sprang forward.</p>
<p>From somewhere a bloody figure in dented armor stumbled. I saw
Lorryn's scarred face twist in amazement as he blinked at the
tableau. His sword, red to the hilt, was bare in his hand.</p>
<p>He saw me with Medea's arms about my neck.</p>
<p>He saw Edeyrn.</p>
<p>And he saw Matholch!</p>
<p>A wordless, inarticulate sound ripped through Lorryn's throat.
He lifted high the sword.</p>
<p>As I tore myself free from Medea's grip, as I sent her reeling
away, I saw Matholch's wand come up. I reached for my own wand, but
there was no need.</p>
<p>Lorryn's blade sang. Matholch's hand, still gripping the wand,
was severed at the wrist. Blood spurted from cut arteries.</p>
<p>Howling, the shape-changer dropped forward. The lycanthropic
change came upon him. Hypnotism, mutation, dark sorcery — I could
not tell. But the thing that sprang at Lorryn's throat was not
human.</p>
<p>Lorryn laughed. He sent his sword spinning away.</p>
<p>He met the wolfling's charge, bracing himself strongly and
caught the thing by throat and leg. Fanged jaws snapped viciously
at him.</p>
<p>Lorryn heaved the monster above his head. His joints cracked
with the inhuman strain. One instant Lorryn stood there, holding
his enemy high, while the wolf-jaws snarled and strove to rend
him.</p>
<p>He dashed the wolf down upon the stones!</p>
<p>I heard bones snap like rotten twigs. I heard a scream of dying,
terrible agony from a gaping muzzle from which blood poured.</p>
<p>Then Matholch, in his own shape, broken, dying, lay writhing at
our feet!</p>
