Swords for the Coven</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>NOW the sap that runs through Ygdrasill-root stirred from its
wintry sluggishness, and the inhuman guardians of the fate-tree
roused to serve me. The three Norns — the Destiny-weavers — I
prayed to them!</p>
<p>Urdur who rules the past!</p>
<p>She whispered of the Covenanters, and their powers and their
weaknesses; of Matholch, the wolfling, whose berserk rages were his
great flaw, the gap in his armor through which I could strike, when
fury had drowned his wary cunning; of the red witch and of Edeyrn —
and of old Ghast Rhymi. My enemies. Enemies whom I could destroy,
with the aid of certain talismans that I had remembered now. Whom I
would destroy!</p>
<p>Verdandi who rules the present!</p>
<p>Edward Bond had done his best. In the caves the rebels had
showed me were weapons, crude rifles and grenades, gas-bombs and
even a few makeshift flame-throwers. They would be useful against
the Coven's slaves. How useless they would be against the
Covenanters I alone knew. Though Freydis may have known too.</p>
<p>Yet Aries and Lorryn and their reckless followers were ready to
use those Earth-weapons, very strange to them, in a desperate
attack on the Castle. And I would give them that chance, as soon as
our spies brought word of Sabbat-preparations. It would be soon. It
would have to be soon. For Llyr was awake now — hungry, thirsting —
beyond the Golden Window that is his door into the worlds of
mankind.</p>
<p>Skuld who rules the future!</p>
<p>To Skuld I prayed most of all. I thought that the Coven would
ride again to Caer Secaire before another dawn came. By then I
wanted the rebels ready.</p>
<p>Edward Bond had trained them well. There was military
discipline, after a fashion. Each man knew his equipment
thoroughly, and all were expert woodsmen. We laid our plans, Aries
and Lorryn and I — though I did not tell them everything I intended
— and group by group, the rebels slipped away into the forest,
bound for the Castle.</p>
<p>They would not attack. They would not reveal themselves until
the signal was given. Meantime, they would wait, concealed in the
gulleys and scrub-woods around the Castle. But they would be ready.
When the time came, they would ride down to the great gates. Their
grenades would be helpful there.</p>
<p>Nor did it seem fantastic that we should battle magic with
grenades and rifle. For I was beginning to realize more and more,
as my memory slowly returned, that the Dark World was not ruled by
laws of pure sorcery. To an Earth-mind such creatures as Matholch
and Medea would have seemed supernatural, but I had a double mind,
for as Ganelon I could use the memories of Edward Bond as a workman
uses tools.</p>
<p>I had forgotten nothing I had ever known about Earth. And by
applying logic to the Dark World, I understood things I had always
before taken for granted.</p>
<p>The mutations gave the key. There are depths in the human mind
forever unplumbed, potentialities for power as there are lost,
atrophied senses — the ancient third eye that is the pineal gland.
And the human organism is the most specialized thing of flesh that
exists.</p>
<p>Any beast of prey is better armed with fang and claw. Man has
only his brain. But as carnivores grew longer, more deadly talons,
so man's mind developed correspondingly. Even in Earth-world there
are mediums, mind-readers, psychomantic experts, ESP specialists.
In the Dark World the mutations had run wild, producing cosmic
abortions for which there might be no real need for another million
years.</p>
<p>And such minds, with their new powers, would develop tools for
those powers. The wands. Though no technician, I could understand
their principle. Science tends toward simpler mechanisms; the
klystron and the magnetron are little more than metal bars. Yet,
under the right conditions, given energy and direction, they are
powerful machines.</p>
<p>Well, the wands tapped the tremendous electromagnetic energy of
the planet, which is, after all, simply a gargantuan magnet. As for
the directive impulse, trained minds could easily supply that.</p>
<p>Whether or not Matholch actually changed to wolf-form I did not
know, though I did not think he did. Hypnosis was part of the
answer. An angry cat will fluff out its fur and seem double its
size. A cobra will, in effect, hypnotize its prey. Why? In order to
break down the enemy's defenses, to disarm him, to weaken the
single-purposiveness that is so vital in combat. No, perhaps
Matholch did not turn into a wolf, but those under the spell of his
hypnosis thought he did, which came to the same thing in the
end.</p>
<p>Medea? There was a parallel. There are diseases in which blood
transfusions are periodically necessary. Not that Medea drank
blood; she had other thirsts. But vital nervous energy is as real a
thing as a leucocyte, and witch though she was, she did not need
magic to serve her needs.</p>
<p>Of Edeyrn I was not so sure. Some stray remembrances hung like
mists in my mind. Once I had known what she was, what chilling
power lay hidden in the darkness of her cowl. And that was not
magic either. The Crystal Mask would protect me against Edeyrn, but
I knew no more than that.</p>
<p>Even Llyr — <em>even Llyr!</em> He was no god. That I knew well.
Yet what he might be was something I could not even guess at as
yet. Eventually I meant to find out, and the Sword Called Llyr,
which was not a true sword, would aid me then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had my part to play. Even with Freydis as my
sponsor, I could not afford to rouse suspicion among the rebels. I
had explained that Medea's drug had left me weak and shaken. That
helped to explain any minor lapses I might make. Curiously, Lorryn
seemed to have accepted me fully at Freydis' word, while in Aries'
behavior I detected a faint, almost imperceptible reserve. I do not
think that she suspected the truth. Or, if she did she was trying
not to admit it, even in her own mind.</p>
<p>And I could not afford to let that suspicion grow.</p>
<p>The valley was very active now.</p>
<p>Much had happened since I came there in the dawn. I had been
through enough exertion both physical and emotional to last an
ordinary man for a week, but Ganelon had only begun his battle. It
was thanks to Edward Bond that our plans for attack would be
formulated so readily, and in a way I was glad I had been too busy
for anything but the most impersonal planning with Aries and
Lorryn.</p>
<p>It helped to cover the great gaps of my ignorance about things
Edward Bond should know. Many times I angled craftily for
information, many times I had to call upon the excuse of the
mythical drug and upon the exhaustion of my ordeal at the Castle.
But by the time our plans were laid, it seemed to me that even
Aries' suspicions were partly lulled.</p>
<p>I knew I must lull them utterly.</p>
<p>We rose from the great map-table in the council-cavern. All of
us were tired. I met Lorryn's scar-twisted grin, warmth in it now
as he smiled at the man he thought his sworn friend, and I made
Edward Bond's face smile back at him.</p>
<p>"We'll do it this time," I told him confidently. "This time
we'll win!"</p>
<p>His smile twisted suddenly into a grimace, and the light like
embers glowed in his deep eyes.</p>
<p>"Remember," he growled. "Matholch — for me!"</p>
<p>I looked down at the relief-map of the table, very skillfully
made under Edward Bond's directions.</p>
<p>The dark green hills rolling with their strange forests of
semi-animate trees, every brook traced in white plaster, every
roadway marked. I laid my hand on the little mound of towers that
was a miniature Castle of the Coven. From it stretched the highway
I had ridden last night, beside Medea, in my blue sacrificial robe.
There was the valley and the windowless tower of Caer Secaire which
had been our destination.</p>
<p>For a moment I rode that highway again, in the darkness and the
starshine, seeing Medea beside me in her scarlet cloak, her face a
pale oval in the dusk, her mouth black-red, her eyes shining at me.
I remembered the feel of that fiercely yielding body in my arms as
I had held her last night, as I had held her so many times before.
In my mind whirled a question.</p>
<p>Medea, Medea, red witch of Colchis, why did you betray me?</p>
<p>I ground my palm down on the tiny plaster towers of the Castle,
feeling them powder away beneath my hand. I grinned fiercely at the
ruin I had made of Edward Bond's model.</p>
<p>"We'll have no need for <em>this</em> again!" I said through my
teeth.</p>
<p>Lorryn laughed.</p>
<p>"No need to repair it. Tomorrow the Coven Castle will be
wreckage too."</p>
<p>I dusted the powdered plaster from my hand and looked across the
table at the silent Aries. She looked at me gravely, waiting. I
smiled.</p>
<p>"We haven't had a moment alone together," I said, making my
voice tender. "I'll need sleep before I leave tonight, but there's
time for a walk, if you'll come with me."</p>
<p>The grave green gaze dwelt upon mine. Then she nodded, without
smiling, and came around the table, stretching out her hand to me.
I took it and we went down the steps to the cave-mouth and out into
the glen, neither of us speaking. I let her lead the way, and we
walked in silence toward the upper end of the valley, the little
stream tinkling away beside us.</p>
<p>Aries walked very lightly, her gossamer hair floating behind her
in a pale misty veil. I wondered if it was by intent that she kept
her free hand resting upon the bolstered weapon at her side.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to keep my mind upon her, or to care whether
or not she knew me for myself. Medea's face in all its beauty and
its evil floated before me up the glen, a face no man who looked
upon it could ever forget. For a moment I was angry at the
recollection that Edward Bond, in my flesh, had taken last night
the kisses she meant for Ganelon.</p>
<p>Well, I would see her again tonight, before she died by my
hand!</p>
<p>In my mind I saw the tiny roadway of the map-table, winding down
from Coven Castle to the sacrificial temple. Along the real road,
sometime in the night to come, I knew the cavalcade would ride
again as it had ridden with me last night. And again there would be
forest men hiding along the road, and again I would lead them
against the Coven. But this time the outcome would be very
different from anything either the rebels or the Coven could
expect.</p>
<p>What a strange web the Morns had woven! Last night as Edward
Bond, tonight as Ganelon, I would lead the same men in the same
combat against the same foe, but with a purpose as different as
night from day.</p>
<p>The two of us, deadly enemies though we shared the same body in
a strange, inverted way — enemies though we had never met and never
could meet, for all our common flesh. It was an enigma too curious
to unravel.</p>
<p>"Edward," a voice said at my shoulder. I looked down.</p>
<p>Aries was facing me with the same enigmatic gaze I had met so
often today. "Edward, is she very beautiful?"</p>
<p>I stared at her.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"The witch. The Coven witch. Medea."</p>
<p>I almost laughed aloud. Was this the answer to all her aloofness
of the day? Did she think my own withdrawal, all the changes she
sensed in me, were due to the charms of a rival beauty? Well, I
must set her mind at rest about that, at any rate. I called upon
Llyr to forgive me the lie, and I took her shoulders in my hands
and said:</p>
<p>"There is no woman on this world or on Earth half so beautiful
as you, my darling.""</p>
<p>Still she looked up at me gravely.</p>
<p>"When you mean that, Edward, I'll be glad," she said. "You don't
mean it now. I can tell. No." She put her fingers across my mouth
as I began to protest. "Let's not talk about her now. She's a
sorceress. She has powers neither of us can fight. It isn't your
fault or mine that she's too beautiful to forget all in a moment.
Never mind now. Look! Do you remember this place?"</p>
<p>She twisted deftly from my grasp and swept out a hand toward the
panorama spread below us. We stood in a grove of tall, quivering
trees high on the crest of the low mountain. The leaves and
branches made a bower around us with their showers of shaking
tendrils, but through an opening here and there we could see the
rolling country far below us, glowing in the light of the red
westering sun.</p>
<p>"This will be ours some day," said Aries softly. "After the
Coven is gone, after Llyr has vanished. We'll be free to live above
ground, clear the forests, build our cities — live like men again.
Think of it, Edward! A whole world freed from savagery. And all
because there were a few of us at the start who did not fear the
Coven, and who found you. If we win the fight, Edward, it will be
because of you and Freydis. We would all have been lost without
you."</p>
<p>She turned suddenly, her pale gold hair flying out around her
face like a halo of floating gauze, and she smiled at me with a
sudden, bewitching charm I had never seen upon her face before.</p>
<p>Until now she had always turned a grave reserve to my advances.
Now suddenly I saw her as Edward Bond had, and it came to me in a
flash of surprise that Bond was a very fortunate man, after all.
Medea's sultry scarlet beauty would never wholly vanish from my
mind, I knew, but this Aries had her own delicate and delightful
charm.</p>
<p>She was very near me, her lips parted as she smiled up into my
face. For an instant I envied Edward Bond. Then I remembered. I
<em>was</em> Edward Bond! But it was Ganelon who stooped suddenly
and seized the forest girl in a fiercely ardent embrace that amazed
her, for I felt her gasp of surprise against my breast and her stir
of protest in the moment before my lips touched hers.</p>
<p>Then she protested no longer.</p>
<p>She was a strange, wild, shy little creature, very pleasant in
my arms, very sweet to kiss. I knew by the way she responded to me
that Edward Bond had never held her like this. But then Edward Bond
was a weakling and a fool. And before the kiss had ended I knew
where I would turn first for solace when Medea had paid for
treachery with her life. I would not forget Medea, but I would not
soon forget this kiss of Aries', either.</p>
<p>She clung to me in silence for a moment, her gossamer hair
floating like thistledown about us both, and above her head I
looked out over the valley which she had seen in her mind's eyes
peopled with free forest folk, dotted with their cities. I knew
that dream would never come true.</p>
<p>But I had a dream of my own!</p>
<p>I saw the forest people toiling to raise my mighty castle here
perhaps on this very mountaintop, a castle to dominate the whole
countryside and the lands beyond it. I saw them laboring under my
overseers to conquer still further lands. I saw my armies marching,
my slaves in my fields and mines, my navies on the dark oceans of a
world that might well be mine.</p>
<p>Aries should share it with me — for awhile. For a little
while.</p>
<p>"I will always love you!" I said at her ear in the voice of
Edward Bond. But it was Ganelon's lips that found her lips in the
one last ardent kiss I had time for then.</p>
<p>Curiously, it seemed to me that it took Ganelon's kisses at last
to convince her I was Edward Bond… .</p>
<p>After that, for a few hours I slept, snug in Edward Bond's
cavern rooms, in his comfortable bed, his guards watching beside
the door. I slept with the memory of his sweet forest girl in my
arms, and the prospect of his kingdom and his bride before me when
I woke. I think in the Earth-world, Edward Bond must have dreamed
jealous dreams.</p>
<p>But my own dreams were bad. Llyr in his castle was awake and
hungry, and the great, cold, writhing tendrils of his hunger coiled
lazily through my mind as I slept. I knew they stirred through
every mind in the Dark World that had senses to perceive them. I
knew I must wake soon, or never. But first I must sleep and grow
strong for the night's ordeal. Resolutely I shut Llyr from my
thoughts, resolutely I shut away Aries.</p>
<p>It was Medea's red smile and sidelong sultry glance that went
down with me into the caverns of slumber.</p>
