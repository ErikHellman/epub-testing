Freydis</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>STRANGE to relate, I felt sure of myself as I walked up the
sloping ramp in the darkness. Ahead of me, around a bend, I could
see the glimmer of firelight, and I smiled. It had been difficult
to speak with these upstart woodsrunners as if they were my equals,
as if I were still Edward Bond. It would be difficult to talk to
their witchwoman as if she had as much knowledge as a Lord of the
Coven. Some she must have, or she could never have managed the
transfer which had sent me into the Earth-world and brought out
Edward Bond. But I thought I could deceive her or anyone these
rebels had to offer me.</p>
<p>The small cave at the turn of the corridor was empty except for
Freydis. Her back was to me. She crouched on her knees before a
small fire that burned, apparently without fuel, in a dish of
crystal. She wore a white robe, and her white hair lay in two heavy
braids along her back. I stopped, trying to feel like Edward Bond
again, to determine what he would have said in this moment. Then
Freydis turned and rose.</p>
<p>She rose tremendously. Few in the Dark World can look me in the
eye, but Freydis' clear blue gaze was level with my own. Her great
shoulders and great, smooth arms were as powerful as a man's, and
if age was upon her, it did not show in her easy motions or in the
timeless face she turned to me. Only in the eyes was knowledge
mirrored, and I knew as I met them that she was old indeed.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Ganelon," she said in her deep, serene voice.</p>
<p>I gaped. She knew me as surely as if she read my mind.</p>
<p>Yet I was sure, or nearly sure, that no one in the Dark World
could do that. For a moment I almost stammered. Then pride came to
my rescue.</p>
<p>"Good day, old woman," I said. "I come to offer you a chance for
your life, if you obey me. We have a score to settle, you and
I."</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Covenanter," she said. "The last time we matched
strength, you traded worlds. Would you like to visit Earth again,
Lord Ganelon?"</p>
<p>It was my turn to laugh.</p>
<p>"You could not. And if you could, you wouldn't, after you hear
me."</p>
<p>Her blue eyes searched mine. —</p>
<p>"You want something desperately," she said in a slow voice.
"Your very presence here, offering me terms, proves that. I never
thought to see the Lord Ganelon face to face unless he was in
chains or in a berserker battle-mood. Your need of me, Lord
Ganelon, serves as chains for you now. You are fettered by your
need, and helpless."</p>
<p>She turned back to the fire and sat down with graceful
smoothness, her huge body under perfect control. Across the flame
in its crystal bowl she faced me.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Ganelon," she said again, "and we will bargain, you
and I. One thing first — do not waste my time with lies. I shall
know if you tell the truth, Covenanter. Remember it."</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>"Why should I bother with lies for such as you?" I said. "I have
nothing to hide from you. The more of truth you know, the stronger
you'll see my case is. First, though — those slaves who came in
before me?</p>
<p>She nodded toward the back of the cave.</p>
<p>"I sent them into the inner mountain. They sleep. You know the
heavy sleep that comes upon those loosed from the Spell, Lord
Ganelon."</p>
<p>I sat down, shaking my head.</p>
<p>"No — no, that I can not quite remember. I — you asked for the
truth, old woman. Listen to it, then. I am Ganelon, but the false
memories of Edward Bond still blur my mind. As Edward Bond I came
here — but Aries told me one thing that brought Ganelon back. She
told me that the Coven, in my hour of weakness, had dressed me in
the blue cloak of the sacrifice and I was riding for Caer Secaire
when the woodsmen attacked us. Must I tell you now what my first
wish in life is, witch-woman?"</p>
<p>"Revenge on the Coven." She said it hollowly, her eyes burning
into mine through the fire. "This is the truth you speak,
Covenanter. You want my help in getting your vengeance. What can
you offer the woodsfolk in return, save fire and sword? Why should
we trust you, Ganelon?"</p>
<p>Her ageless eyes burned into mine.</p>
<p>"Because of what you want. My desire is vengeance. Yours is —
what?"</p>
<p>"The end of Llyr — the ruin of the Coven!" Her voice was
resonant and her whole ageless face lighted as she spoke.</p>
<p>"So. I too desire the ruin of the Coven and the end — the end of
Llyr." My tongue stumbled a little when I said that. I was not sure
why. True, I had been sealed to Llyr in a great and terrible
ceremony once — I could recall that much. But Llyr and I were not
one. We might have been, had events run differently. I shuddered
now at the thought of it.</p>
<p>Yes, it was Llyr's end I desired now — must desire, if I hoped
to live.</p>
<p>Freydis looked at me keenly. She nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes — perhaps you do. Perhaps you do. What do you want of us
then, Ganelon?"</p>
<p>I spoke hastily:</p>
<p>"I want you to swear to your people that I am Edward Bond. No —
wait! I can do more for them now than Edward Bond could do. Give
thanks that I am Ganelon again, old woman! For only he can help
you. Listen to me. Your foresters could not kill me. I know that.
Ganelon is deathless, except on Llyr's altar. But they could fetter
me and keep me prisoner here until you could work your spells again
and bring Edward Bond back. And that would be foolish for your sake
and for mine.</p>
<p>"Edward Bond has done all he knows for you. Now it's Ganelon's
turn. Who else could tell you how Llyr is vulnerable, or where
Matholch keeps his secret weapons, or how one can vanquish Edeyrn?
These things I know — or I once knew. You must help me win my
memories back, Freydis. After that — " I grinned fiercely.</p>
<p>She nodded. Then she sat quiet for awhile.</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do, then, Ganelon?" she asked, at
last.</p>
<p>"Tell me first about the bridging of the worlds," I said
eagerly. "How did you change Edward Bond and me?"</p>
<p>Freydis smiled grimly.</p>
<p>"Not so fast, Covenanter!" she answered. "I have my secrets too!
I will answer only a part of that question. We wrought the change,
as you must guess, simply to rid ourselves of you. You must
remember how fiercely you were pressing us in your raids for
slaves, in your hatred of our freedom. We are a proud people,
Ganelon, and we would not be oppressed forever. But we knew there
was no death for you except in a way we could not use.</p>
<p>"I knew of the twin world of Earth. I searched, and found Edward
Bond. And after much striving, much effort, I wrought a certain
transition that put you in the other world, with memories of Edward
Bond blotting out your own.</p>
<p>"We were rid of you. True, we had Edward Bond with us, and we
did not trust him either. He was too like you. But him we could
kill if we must. We did not. He is a strong man, Covenanter. We
came to trust him and rely upon him. He brought us new ideas of
warfare. He was a good leader. It was he who planned the attack
upon the next Coven sacrifice —"</p>
<p>"An attack that failed," I said. "Or would have failed, had I
not swung my weight into the balance. Edward Bond had
Earth-knowledge, yes. But his weapons and defenses could only have
breached the outer walls of the Coven. You know there are powers,
seldom used, but powers that do not fail!"</p>
<p>"I know," she said. "Yes, I know, Ganelon. Yet we had to try, at
least. And the Coven had been weakened by losing you. Without you,
none of the others would have dared call on Llyr, except perhaps
Ghast Rhymi." She stared deeply into the fire. "I know you Ganelon.
I know the pride that burns in your soul. And I know, too, that
vengeance, now, would be very dear to your heart. Yet you were
sealed to Llyr, once, and you have been Covenanter since your
birth. How do I know you can be trusted?"</p>
<p>I did not answer that. And, after a moment, Freydis turned
toward the smoke-blackened wall. She twitched aside a curtain I had
not seen. There, in an alcove, was a Symbol, a very ancient Sign,
older than civilization, older than human speech.</p>
<p>Yes, Freydis would be one of the few who knew what that Symbol
meant. As I knew.</p>
<p>"Now will you swear that you speak with a straight tongue?" she
said.</p>
<p>I moved my hand in the ritual gesture that bound me irrevocably.
This was an oath I could not break without being damned and doubly
damned, in this world and the next. But I had no hesitation. I
spoke truth!</p>
<p>"I will destroy the Coven!" I said.</p>
<p>"And Llyr?"</p>
<p>"I will bring an end to Llyr!"</p>
<p>But sweat stood out on my forehead as I said that. It was not
easy.</p>
<p>Freydis twitched the curtain back into place. She seemed
satisfied.</p>
<p>"I have less doubt now," she said. "Well, Ganelon, the Norns
weave strange threads together to make warp and woof of destiny.
Yet there is a pattern, though sometimes we cannot see it. I did
not ask you to swear fealty to the forest-folk."</p>
<p>"I realize that."</p>
<p>"You would not have sworn it," she said. "Nor is it necessary.
After the Coven is broken, after an end is made to Llyr, I can
guard the people of the woods against even you, Ganelon. And we may
meet in battle then. But until then we are allies. I will name you
— Edward Bond."</p>
<p>"I'll need more than that," I told her. "If the masquerade is to
pass unchallenged."</p>
<p>"No one will doubt my word," Freydis said. Firelight flickered
on her great frame, her smooth, ageless face.</p>
<p>"I cannot fight the Coven till I get back my memories. The
memories of Ganelon. <em>All</em> of them."</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Well," she said slowly, "I cannot do too much on that score.
Something, yes. But writing on the mind is touchy work, and
memories, once erased, are not easily brought back. You still have
Edward Bond's memories?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"But my own, no. They're fragmentary. I know, for example, that
I was sealed to Llyr, but the details I don't remember."</p>
<p>"It would be as well, perhaps, to let that memory stay
lost,"</p>
<p>Freydis said somberly. "But you are right. A dulled tool is no
use. So listen."</p>
<p>Rock-still, boulder-huge, she stood across the fire from me. Her
voice deepened.</p>
<p>"I sent you into the Earth-World. I brought your double, Edward
Bond, here. He helped us, and — Aries loved him, after a while.
Even Lorryn, who does not trust many, grew to trust Edward
Bond."</p>
<p>"Who is Lorryn?"</p>
<p>"One of us now. Not always. Years ago he had his cottage in the
forest; he hunted, and few were as cunning as Lorryn in the chase.
His wife was very young. Well, she died. Lorryn came back to this
cottage one night and found death there, and blood, and a wolf that
snarled at him from a bloody muzzle. He fought the wolf; he did not
kill it. You saw Lorryn's cheek. His whole body is like that,
scarred and wealed from wolf-fangs."</p>
<p>"A wolf?" I said. "Not —"</p>
<p>"A wolfling," Freydis said. "Lycanthrope, shape-changer.
Matholch. Some day Lorryn will kill Matholch. He lives only for
that."</p>
<p>"Let him have the red dog," I said contemptuously. "If he likes,
I'll give him Matholch flayed!"</p>
<p>"Aries and Lorryn and Edward Bond have planned their campaign,"
Freydis said. "They swore that the last Sabbat had been celebrated
in the Dark World. Edward Bond showed them new weapons he
remembered from Earth. Such weapons have been built and are in the
arsenal, ready. No Sabbats have been held since Medea and her
followers went searching to Earth; the woodsfolk held their hands.
There was nothing to strike at except old Ghast Rhymi. Now Medea
and the rest of the Coven are back, they're ready. If you lead
against them Ganelon, the Coven can be smashed, I think."</p>
<p>"The Coven has its own weapons," I muttered. "My memory fails —
but I think Edeym has a power that — that — " I shook my head. "No,
it's gone."</p>
<p>"How can Llyr be destroyed?" Freydis asked.</p>
<p>"I — I may have known once. Not now."</p>
<p>"Look at me," she said. And leaned forward, so that it seemed as
though her ageless face was bathed in the fires.</p>
<p>Through the flames her gaze caught mine. Some ancient power
kindled her clear blue eyes. Like pools of cool water under a
bright sky — pools deep and unstirring, where one could sink into
an azure silence forever and ever… .</p>
<p>As I looked the blue waters clouded, grew dark. I saw a great
black dome against a black sky. I saw the thing that dwells deepest
and most strongly in the mind of Ganelon — Caer Llyr!</p>
<p>The dome swam closer. It loomed above me. Its walls parted like
dark water, and I moved in memory down the great smooth, shining
corridor that leads to Llyr Himself.</p>
