Freedom at Last!</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>HURRIEDLY TWO cold, smooth hands pressed hard upon my forehead.
I looked up. They slid lower, covering my eyes. And weakness was
like a blanket over me. I knelt there, unresisting, feeling the
body of the man who had been myself slide limply from my knee.</p>
<p>Freydis pressed me down. We lay side by side, the living and the
dead.</p>
<p>The silver rods of the sorceress touched my head, and made a
bridge between Edward Bond and Ganelon. I remembered Medea's wand
that could draw the life-force from the mind. A dull, numbing
paralysis had me. Little tingling shocks rippled through my nerves,
and I could not move.</p>
<p>Sudden agonizing pain shot through me. My back! I tried to
scream with the white fury of that wrenching agony, but my throat
was frozen. I felt Edward Bond's wounds!</p>
<p>In that nightmare moment, while my brain spun down the limitless
corridors of a science beyond that of mankind, I knew what Freydis
had done — what she was doing.</p>
<p>I felt the mind of Edward Bond come back from the gulfs. Side by
side we lay in flesh, and side by side in spirit as well.</p>
<p>There was blackness, and two flames, burning with a cold, clear
fire… .</p>
<p>One was the mind — the life — of Edward Bond. One was my
life!</p>
<p>The flames bent toward each other!</p>
<p>They mingled and were one!</p>
<p>Life and soul and mind of Edward Bond merged with life of
Ganelon!</p>
<p>Where two flames had burned, there was one now. One only.</p>
<p>And the identity of Ganelon ebbed, sank… faded into a graying
shadow as the fires of Edward Bond's life leaped even higher!</p>
<p>We were one. We were —</p>
<p>Edward Bond! No longer Ganelon! No longer Lord of the Dark
World, Master of the Caere!</p>
<p>Magic of Freydis drowned the soul of Ganelon and gave his body
to the life of Edward Bond!</p>
<p>I saw Ganelon — <em>die!…</em></p>
<p>When I opened my eyes again, I knelt upon the altar that had
been Llyr's. The empty vaults towered hollowly above us. Limbo was
gone. The body across my knee was gone. Freydis smiled down at me
with her ageless, timeless smile.</p>
<p>"Welcome back to the Dark World, Edward Bond."</p>
<p>Yes, it was true. I knew that. I knew it was my own identity,
housed though it was in another man's body. Dizzily I blinked,
shook my head, and rose slowly. Pain struck savagely at my side,
and I gasped and let Freydis spring forward to support me on one
great white arm, while the hollow building reeled about me. But
Ganelon was gone. He had vanished with limbo, vanished like a
scatter of smoke, vanished as if the prayer he breathed in his
extremity had been answered by the nameless god he prayed to.</p>
<p>I was Edward Bond again.</p>
<p>"Do you know why Ganelon could break you, Edward Bond?" Freydis
said softly. "Do you know why you could not vanquish him? It was
not what he thought. I know he believed he read your mind because
he had dwelt there, but that was not the reason. When a man fights
himself, my son, the same man does not fight to win. Only the
suicide hates himself. Deep within Ganelon lay knowledge of his own
evil, and the hatred of it. So he could strike his own image and
exult in the blow, because he hated himself in the depths of his
own mind.</p>
<p>"But you had earned your own respect. You could not strike as
hard as he because you are not evil. And Ganelon won — and lost. In
the end, he did not fight me. He had slain himself, and the man who
does that has no combat left in him."</p>
<p>Her voice sank to a murmur. Then she laughed.</p>
<p>"Go out now, Edward Bond. There is much to be done in the Dark
World!"</p>
<p>So, leaning upon her arm, I went down the long steps that
Ganelon had climbed. I saw the green glimmer of the day outside,
the shimmer of leaves, the motion of waiting people. I remembered
all that Ganelon had remembered, but upon the mind of Ganelon the
mind of Edward Bond was forever superimposed, and I knew that only
thus could the Dark World be ruled.</p>
<p>The two together, twinned forever in one body, and the control
forever mine — Edward Bond's.</p>
<p>We came out under the emptied arch of the opening, and daylight
was blinding for a moment after that haunted darkness. Then I saw
the foresters anxiously clustering in then- battered ranks around
the Caer, and I saw a pale girl in green, haloed by her floating
hair, turn a face of incredulous radiance to mine.</p>
<p>I forgot the pain in my side.</p>
<p>Aries' hair swam like mist about us both as my arms closed
around her. The roar of exultation that went up from the forest
people swept the clearing and made the great Caer behind us echo
through all its hollow vaults.</p>
<p>The Dark World was free, and ours.</p>
<p>But Medea, Medea, red witch of Colchis, how we might have
reigned together!</p>
