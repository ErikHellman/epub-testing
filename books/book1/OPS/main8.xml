Realm of the Superconscious</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>ONWARD I moved. Faces flickered before me — Matholch's fierce
grin, Edeyrn's cowled head with its glance that chilled, Medea's
savage beauty that no man could ever forget, even in his hatred.
They looked at me, mistrustfully. Their lips moved in soundless
question. Curiously, I knew these were real faces I saw.</p>
<p>In the magic of Freydis' spell I was drifting through some
dimensionless place where only the mind ventures, and I was meeting
here the thoughts of the questing Coven, meeting the eyes of their
minds. They knew me. They asked me fiercely a question I could not
hear.</p>
<p>Death was in the face Matholch's mind turned to mine. All his
hatred of me boiled furiously in his yellow wolf-eyes. His lips
moved — almost I could hear him. Medea's features swam up before
me, blotting out the shape-changer. Her red mouth framed a question
— over and over.</p>
<p>"Ganelon, where are you? Ganelon, my lover, where are you? You
must come back to us. Ganelon!"</p>
<p>Edeyrn's faceless head moved between Medea and me, and very
distantly I heard her cool, small voice echoing the same
thought.</p>
<p>"You must return to us, Ganelon. Return to us and die!"</p>
<p>Anger drew a red curtain between those faces and myself.</p>
<p>Traitors, betrayers, false to the Coven oath! How dared they
threaten Ganelon, the strongest of them all? How dared they — and
why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>My brain reeled with the query. And then I realized there was
one face missing from the Coven. These three had been searching the
thought-planes for me, but what of Ghast Rhymi?</p>
<p>Deliberately I groped for the contact of his mind.</p>
<p>I could not touch him. But I remembered. I remembered Ghast
Rhymi, whose face Edward Bond had never seen. Old, old, old, beyond
good and evil, beyond fear and hatred, this was Ghast Rhymi, the
wisest of the Coven. If he willed, he would answer my groping
thought. If he willed not, nothing could force him. Nothing could
harm the Eldest, for he lived on only by force of his own will.</p>
<p>He could end himself instantly, by the power of a thought. And
he is like a candle flame, flickering away as one grasps at him.
Life holds nothing more for him. He does not cling to it. If I had
tried to seize him he could slip like fire or water from my grasp.
He would as soon be dead as alive. But unless he must, he would not
break his deep calm to think the thought that would change him into
clay.</p>
<p>His mind and the image of his face remained hidden from my
quest. He would not answer. The rest of the Coven still kept
calling to me with a strange desperation in their minds — return
and die, Lord Ganelon! But Ghast Rhymi did not care.</p>
<p>So I knew that it was at his command the death-sentence had been
passed. And I knew I must seek him out and somehow force an answer
from him — from Ghast Rhymi, upon whom all force was strengthless.
Yet force him I must!</p>
<p>All this while my mind had been drifting effortlessly down the
great hallway of Caer Llyr, borne upon that tide that flows deepest
in the mind of Ganelon, the Chosen of Llyr — Ganelon, who must one
day return to Him Who Waits… . As I was returning now.</p>
<p>A golden window glowed before me. I knew it for the window
through which great Llyr looks out upon his world, the window
through which he reaches for his sacrifices. And Llyr was hungry. I
felt his hunger. Llyr was roaming the thought-planes too, and in
the moment that I realized again where my mind was drifting, I felt
suddenly the stir of a great reaching, a tentacular groping through
the golden window.</p>
<p>Llyr had sensed my presence in the planes of his mind. He knew
his Chosen. He stretched out his godlike grasp to fold me into that
embrace from which there is no returning.</p>
<p>I heard the soundless cry of Medea, vanishing like a puff of
smoke out of the thought-plane as she blanked her mind defensively
from the terror. I heard Matholch's voiceless howl of pure fear as
he closed his own mind. There was no sound from Edeyrn, but she was
gone as utterly as if she had never thought a thought. I knew the
three of them sat somewhere in their castle, eyes and minds closed
tightly, willing themselves to blankness as Llyr roamed the
thought-lanes seeking the food he had been denied so long.</p>
<p>A part of me shared the terror of the Coven. But a part of me
remembered Llyr. For an instant, almost I recaptured the dark
ecstasy of that moment when Llyr and I were one, and the memory of
horror and of dreadful joy came back, the memory of a power
transcending all earthly things.</p>
<p>This was mine for the taking, if I opened ray mind to Llyr. Only
one man in a generation is sealed to Llyr, sharing in his godhead,
exulting with him in the ecstasy of human sacrifice — and I was
that one man if I chose to complete the ceremony that would make me
Llyr's. If I chose, if I dared — ah!</p>
<p>The memory of anger came back. I must not release myself into
that promised joy. I had sworn to put an end to Llyr. I had sworn
by the Sign to finish the Coven and Llyr. Slowly, reluctantly, my
mind pulled itself back from the fringing contact of those
tentacles.</p>
<p>The moment that tentative contact was broken, a full tide of
horror washed over me. Almost I had touched — <em>him.</em> Almost
I had let myself be defiled beyond all human understanding by the
terrible touch of — of — There is no word in any language for the
thing that was Llyr. But I understood what had been in my mind as
Edward Bond when I realized that to dwell on the same soil as Llyr,
share the same life, was a defilement that made earth and life too
terrible to endure — if one knew Llyr.</p>
<p>I must put an end to <em>him.</em> In that moment, I knew I must
stand up and face the being we knew as Llyr and fight him to his
end. No human creature had ever fully faced him — not even his
sacrifices, not even his Chosen. But his slayer would have to face
him, and I had sworn to be his slayer.</p>
<p>Shuddering, I drew back from the black depths of Caer Llyr,
struggled to the surface of that still blue pool of thought which
had been Freydis' eyes. The darkness ebbed around me and by degrees
the walls of the cave came back, the fuelless flame, the great
smooth-limbed sorceress who held my mind in the motionless deeps of
her spell.</p>
<p>As I returned to awareness, slowly, slowly, knowledge darted
through my mind in lightning-flashes, too swiftly to shape into
words.</p>
<p>I knew, I remembered.</p>
<p>Ganelon's life came back in pictures that went vividly by and
were printed forever on my brain. I knew his powers; I knew his
secret strengths, his hidden weaknesses. I knew his sins. I exulted
in his power and pride. I returned to my own identity and was fully
Ganelon again. Or almost fully.</p>
<p>But there were still hidden things. Too much had been erased
from my memory to come back in one full tide. There were gaps, and
important gaps, in what I could recall.</p>
<p>The blue darkness cleared. I looked in Freydis' clear gaze
across the fire. I smiled, feeling a cold and arrogant confidence
welling up in-me.</p>
<p>"You have done well, witch-woman," I told her.</p>
<p>"You remember?"</p>
<p>"Enough. Yes, enough." I laughed. "There are two trials before
me, and the first is the easier of the two, and it is impossible.
But I shall accomplish it."</p>
<p>"Ghast Rhymi?" she asked in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>"How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"I know the Coven. And I think, but I am not sure, that in Ghast
Rhymi's hands lie the secrets of the Coven and of Llyr. But no man
can force Ghast Rhymi to do his bidding."</p>
<p>"I'll find the way. Yes, I will even tell you what my next task
is. You shall have the truth as I just learned it, witch. Do you
know of the Mask and the Wand?"</p>
<p>Her eyes on mine, she shook her head. "Tell me. Perhaps I can
help."</p>
<p>I laughed again. It was so fantastically implausible that she
and I should stand here, sworn enemies of enemy clans, planning a
single purpose together! Yet there was only a little I hid from her
that day, and I think not very much that Freydis hid from me.</p>
<p>"In the palace of Medea, is a crystal mask and the silver Wand
of Power," I told her. "What that Wand is I do not quite remember —
yet. But when I find it, my hands will know. And with it I can
overcome Medea and Matholch and all their powers. As for Edeyrn —
well, this much I know. The Mask will save me from her."</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>Medea I knew now. I knew the strange hungers and the stranger
thirsts that drove the beautiful red and white witch to her
trystings. I knew now, and shuddered a little to think of it, why
she took her captives with those arrows of fire that did not kill
at all, but only stunned them.</p>
<p>In the Dark World, my world, mutation has played strange changes
upon flesh that began as human. Medea was one of the strangest of
all. There is no word in Earth-tongues for it, because no creature
such as Medea ever walked Earth. But there is an approximation. In
reality perhaps, and certainly in legend, beings a little like her
have been known on Earth. The name they give them is Vampire.</p>
<p>But Edeyrn, no. I could not remember. It may be that not even
Ganelon had ever known. I only knew that in time of need, Edeyrn
would uncover her face.</p>
<p>"Freydis," I said, and hesitated again. "What is Edeyrn?"</p>
<p>She shook her massive head, the white braids stirring on her
shoulders.</p>
<p>"I have never known. I have only probed at her mind now and
then, when we met as you met her today, on the thought-lanes. I
have much power, Ganelon, but I have always drawn back from the
chill I sensed beneath Edeyrn's hood. No, I cannot tell you what
she is."</p>
<p>I laughed again. Recklessness was upon me now.</p>
<p>"Forget Edeyrn," I said. "When I have forced Ghast Rhymi to my
bidding, and faced Llyr with the weapon that will end him, what
shall I fear of Edeyrn? The Crystal Mask is a talisman against her.
That much I know. Let her be whatever monstrous thing she wills —
Ganelon has no fear of her.</p>
<p>"There is a weapon, then against Llyr too?"</p>
<p>"There is a sword," I said. "A sword that is — is not quite a
sword as we think of weapons. My mind is cloudy there still. But I
know that Ghast Rhymi can tell me where it is. A weapon, yet not a
weapon. The Sword Called Llyr."</p>
<p>For an instant, as I spoke that name, it seemed to me that the
fire between us flickered as if a shadow had passed across its
brightness. I should not have called the name aloud. An echo of it
had gone ringing across the realms of thought, and in Caer Llyr
perhaps Llyr Himself had stirred behind the golden window —
stirred, and looked out.</p>
<p>Even here, I felt a faint flicker of hunger from that far-away
domed place. And suddenly, I knew what I had done, <em>Llyr was
awake!</em></p>
<p>I stared at Freydis with widened eyes, meeting her blue gaze
that was widening too. She must have felt the stir as it ran
formlessly all through the Dark World. In the Castle of the Coven I
knew they had felt it too, perhaps that they looked at one another
with the same instant dread which flashed between Freydis and me
here.</p>
<p><em>Llyr was awake!</em></p>
<p>And I had wakened him. I had gone drifting in thought down that
shining corridor and stood in thought before the very window
itself, Llyr's Chosen, facing Llyr's living window. No wonder he
had stirred at last to full awakening.</p>
<p>Exultation bubbled up in my mind.</p>
<p>"Now they must move!" I told Freydis joyfully. "You wrought
better than you knew when you set my mind free to rove its old
track. Llyr wakens and is hungrier man the Coven ever dared let him
grow before. For overlong there has been no Sabbat, and Llyr ravens
for his sacrifice. Have you spies watching the Castle now,
witch-woman?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Good. Then we will know when the slaves are gathered again for
a Sabbat meeting. It will be soon. It must be soon! And Edward Bond
will lead an assault upon the Castle while the Coven are at Sabbat
in Caer Secaire. There will be the Mask and the Wand, old woman!"
My voice deepened to a chant of triumph. "The Mask and the Wand for
Ganelon, and Ghast Rhymi alone in the Castle to answer me if he
can! The Norns fight on our side, Freydis!"</p>
<p>She looked at me long and without speaking.</p>
<p>Then a grim smile broke across her face and stooping, she spread
her bare hand, palm down, upon the fuelless flame. I saw the fire
lick up around her fingers. Deliberately she crushed it out beneath
her hand, not flinching at all.</p>
<p>The fire flared and died away. The crystal dish stood empty upon
its pedestal, and dimness closed around us. In that twilight the
woman was a great figure of marble, towering beside me.</p>
<p>I heard her deep voice.</p>
<p>"The Norns are with us, Ganelon," she echoed. "See that you
fight upon our side too, as far as your oath will take you. Or you
must answer to the gods and to me. And by the gods — " she laughed
harshly " — by the gods, if you betray me, I swear I'll smash you
with no other power than this!''</p>
<p>In the dimness I saw her lift her great arms. We looked one
another in the eye, this mighty sorceress and I, and I was not sure
but that she could overcome me in single combat if the need arose.
By magic and by sheer muscle, I recognized an equal. I bent my
head.</p>
<p>"So be it, Sorceress," I said, and we clasped hands there in the
darkness. And almost I hoped I need not have to betray her.</p>
<p>Side by side, we went down the corridor to the cave mouth.</p>
<p>The half-circle of foresters still awaited us. Aries and the
scarred Lorryn stood a little forward, lifting their heads eagerly
as we emerged. I paused, catching the quiver of motion as calloused
hands slipped stealthily toward hilt and bowstring. Panic, subdued
and breathless, swept around the arc of woods-folk.</p>
<p>I stood there savoring the moment of terror among them, knowing
myself Ganelon and the nemesis that would bring harsh justice upon
them all, in my own time. In my own good time.</p>
<p>But first I needed their help.</p>
<p>At my shoulder the deep voice of Freydis boomed through the
glade.</p>
<p>"I have looked upon this man," she said. "I name him — Edward
Bond."</p>
<p>Distrust of me fell away from them; Freydis' words reassured
them.</p>
