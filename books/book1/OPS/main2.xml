Locked Worlds</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>ACHING IN every muscle, I woke and lay motionless, staring at
the low ceiling. Memory flooded back. I turned my head, realizing
that I lay on a soft couch padded with silks and pillows. Across
the bare, simply furnished room was a recessed window, translucent,
for it admitted light, but I could see only vague blurs through
it.</p>
<p>Seated beside me, on a three-legged stool, was the dwarfed,
robed figure I knew was Edeym.</p>
<p>Not even now could I see the face; the shadows within the cowl
were too deep. I felt the keen glint of a watchful gaze, though,
and a breath of something unfamiliar — cold and deadly. The robes
were saffron, an ugly hue that held nothing of life in the harsh
folds. Staring, I saw that the creature was less than four feet
tall, or would have been had it stood upright.</p>
<p>Again I heard that sweet, childish, sexless voice.</p>
<p>"Will you drink, Lord Ganelon? Or eat?"</p>
<p>I threw back the gossamer robe covering me and sat up. I was
wearing a thin tunic of silvery softness, and trunks of the same
material. Edeyrn apparently had not moved, but a drapery swung
apart in the wall, and a man came silently in, bearing a covered
tray.</p>
<p>Sight of him was reassuring. He was a big man, sturdily muscled,
and under a plumed Etruscan-styled helmet his face was tanned and
strong. I thought so till I met his eyes. They were blue pools in
which horror had drowned. And ancient fear, so familiar that it was
almost submerged, lay deep in his gaze.</p>
<p>Silently he served me and in silence withdrew.</p>
<p>Edeyrn nodded toward the tray.</p>
<p>"Eat and drink. You will be stronger, Lord Ganelon."</p>
<p>There were meats and bread, of a sort, and a glass of colorless
liquid that was not water, as I found on sampling it. I took a sip,
set down the chalice, and scowled at Edeyrn.</p>
<p>"I gather that I'm not insane," I said.</p>
<p>"You are not. Your soul has been elsewhere — <em>you</em> have
been in exile — but you are home again now."</p>
<p>"In Caer Llyr?" I asked, without quite knowing why.</p>
<p>Edeyrn shook the saffron robes.</p>
<p>"No. But you must remember?"</p>
<p>"I remember nothing. Who are you? What's happened to me?"</p>
<p>"You know that you are Ganelon?"</p>
<p>"My name's Edward Bond."</p>
<p>"Yet you almost remembered — at the Need-fire," Edeym said.
"This will take time. And there is danger always. Who am I? I am
Edeyrn — who serves the Coven."</p>
<p>"Are you —"</p>
<p>"A woman," she said, in that childish, sweet voice, laughing a
little. "A very <em>old</em> woman, the oldest of the Coven, it has
shrunk from its original thirteen. There is Medea, of course, Lord
Matholch — " I remembered the wolf — "Ghast Rhymi, who has more
power than any of us, but is too old to use it. And you, Lord
Ganelon, or Edward Bond, as you name yourself. Five of us in all
now. Once there were hundreds, but even I cannot remember that
time, though Ghast Rhymi can, if he would."</p>
<p>I put my head in my hands.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, I don't know! Your words mean nothing to me. I
don't even know where I am!"</p>
<p>"Listen," she said, and I felt a soft touch on my shoulder. "You
must understand this. You have lost your memories."</p>
<p>"That's not true."</p>
<p>"It <em>is</em> true, Lord Ganelon. Your true memories were
erased, and you were given artificial ones. All you think you
recall now, of your life on the Earth-world — all that is false. It
did not happen. At least, not to you."</p>
<p>"The Earth-world? I'm not on Earth?"</p>
<p>"This is a different world," she said. "But it is your own
world. You came from here originally. The Rebels, our enemies,
exiled you and changed your memories."</p>
<p>"That's impossible."</p>
<p>"Come here," Edeyrn said, and went to the window. She touched
something, and the pane grew transparent. I looked over her
shrouded head at a landscape I have never seen before.</p>
<p>Or had I?</p>
<p>Under a dull, crimson sun the rolling forest below lay bathed in
bloody light. I was looking down from a considerable height, and
could not make out details, but it seemed to me that the trees were
oddly shaped and that they were moving. A river ran toward distant
hills. A few white towers rose from the forest. That was all. Yet
the scarlet, huge sun had told me enough. This was not the Earth I
knew.</p>
<p>"Another planet?"</p>
<p>"More than that," she said. "Few in the Dark World know this.
But <em>I</em> know — and there are some others who have learned,
unluckily for you. There are worlds of probability, divergent in
the stream of time, but identical almost, until the branches
diverge too far."</p>
<p>"I don't understand that."</p>
<p>"Worlds coexistent in time and space — but separated by another
dimension, the variant of probability. This is the world that might
have been yours had <em>something</em> not happened, long ago.
Originally the Dark World and the Earth-world were one, in space
and time. Then a decision was made — a very vital decision, though
I am not sure what it was. From that point the time-stream
branched, and two variant worlds existed where there had been only
one before.</p>
<p>"They were utterly identical at first, except that in one of
them the key decision had <em>not</em> been made. The results were
very different. It happened hundreds of years ago, but the two
variant worlds are still close together in the time stream.
Eventually they will drift farther apart, and grow less like each
other. Meanwhile, they <em>are</em> similar, so much so that a man
on the Earth-world may have his twin in the Dark World."</p>
<p>"His twin?"</p>
<p>"The man he might have been, had the key decision not been made
ages ago in his world. Yes, twins, Ganelon — Edward Bond. Do you
understand now?"</p>
<p>I returned to the couch and sat there, frowning.</p>
<p>'Two worlds, coexistent. I can understand that, yes. But I think
you mean more — that a double for me exists somewhere."</p>
<p>"You were born in the Dark World. Your double, the true Edward
Bond, was born on Earth. But we have enemies here, woods-runners,
rebels, and they have stolen enough knowledge to bridge the gulf
between time-variants. We ourselves learned the method only lately,
though once it was well-known here, among the Coven.</p>
<p>"The rebels reached out across the gulf and sent you — sent
Ganelon — into the Earth-world so that Edward Bond could come here,
among them. They —"</p>
<p>"But why?" I interrupted. "What reason could they have for
that?"</p>
<p>Edeyrn turned her hooded head toward me, and I felt, not for the
first time, remote chill as she fixed her unseen gaze upon my
face.</p>
<p>"What reason?" she echoed in her sweet, cool voice. "Think,
Ganelon. See if you remember."</p>
<p>I thought, I closed my eyes and tried to submerge my conscious
mind, to let the memories of Ganelon rise up to the surface if they
were there at all. I could not yet accept this preposterous thought
in its entirety, but certainly it would explain a great deal if it
were true. It would even explain — I realized suddenly — that
strange blanking out in the plane over the Sumatra jungle, that
moment from which everything had seemed so wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was the moment when Edward Bond left Earth, and
Ganelon took his place — both twins too stunned and helpless at the
change to know what had happened, or to understand.</p>
<p>But this was impossible!</p>
<p>"I don't remember!" I said harshly. "It can't have happened. I
<em>know</em> who I am! I know everything that ever happened to
Edward Bond. You can't tell me that all this is only illusion. It's
too clear, too real!"</p>
<p>"Ganelon, Ganelon," Edeyrn crooned to me, a smile in her voice.
"Think of the rebel tribes. Try, Ganelon. Try to remember why they
did what they did to you. The woods-runners, Ganelon — the
disobedient little men in green. The hateful men who threatened us.
Ganelon, surely you remember!"</p>
<p>It may have been a form of hypnotism. I thought of that later.
But at that moment, a picture did swim into my mind. I could see
the green-clad swarms moving through the woods, and the sight of
them made me hot with sudden anger. For that instant I was Ganelon,
and a great and powerful lord, defied by these underlings not fit
to tie my shoe.</p>
<p>"Of course you hated them," murmured Edeyrn. She may have seen
the look on my face. I felt the stiffness of an unfamiliar twist of
feature as she spoke. I had straightened where I sat, and my
shoulders had gone back arrogantly, my lip curling a feeling of
scorn. So perhaps she did not read my mind at all. What I thought
was plain in my face and bearing.</p>
<p>"Of course you punished them when you could," she went on. "It
was your right and duty. But they duped you, Ganelon. They were
cleverer than you. They found a door that would turn on a temporal
axis and thrust you into another world. On the far side of the door
was Edward Bond who did not hate them. So they opened the
door."</p>
<p>Edeyrn's voice rose slightly and in it I detected a note of
mockery.</p>
<p>"False memories, false memories, Ganelon. You put on Edward
Bond's past when you put on his identity. But he came into our
world as he was, free of any knowledge of Ganelon. He has given us
much trouble, my friend, and much bewilderment. At first we did not
guess what had gone wrong. It seemed to us that as Ganelon vanished
from our Coven, a strange new Ganelon appeared among the rebels,
organizing them to fight against his own people." She laughed
softly. "We had to rouse Ghast Rhymi from his sleep to aid us. But
in the end, learning the method of door-opening, we came to Earth
and searched for you, and found you. And brought you back. This is
your world, Lord Ganelon! Will you accept it?"</p>
<p>I shook my head dizzily.</p>
<p>"It isn't real. I'm still Edward Bond."</p>
<p>"We can bring back your true memories. And we will. They came to
the surface for a moment, I think, just now. But it will take time.
Meanwhile, you are one of the Coven, and Edward Bond is back upon
Earth in his old place. Remembering — " She laughed softly.
"Remembering, I am sure, all he left undone here. But helpless to
return, or meddle again in what does not concern him. But we have
needed you, Ganelon. How badly we have needed you!"</p>
<p>"What can I do? I'm Edward Bond."</p>
<p>"Ganelon can do much — when he remembers. The Coven has fallen
upon evil days. Once we were thirteen. Once there were other Covens
to join us in our Sabbats. Once we ruled this whole world, under
Great Llyr. But Llyr is falling asleep now. He draws farther and
farther away from his worshippers. By degrees the Dark World has
fallen into savagery. And, of all the Covens, only we remain, a
broken circle, dwelling close to Caer Llyr where the Great One
sleeps beyond his Golden Window."</p>
<p>She fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I think that Llyr does not sleep at all," she said.
"I think he is withdrawing, little by little, into some farther
world, losing his interest in us whom he created. But he returns!"
She laughed. "Yes, he returns when the sacrifices stand before his
Window. And so long as he comes back, the Coven has power to force
its will upon the Dark World.</p>
<p>"But day by day the forest rebels grow stronger, Ganelon. With
our help, you were gathering power to oppose them — when you
vanished. We needed you then, and we need you more man ever now.
You are one of the Coven, perhaps the greatest of us all. With
Matholch you were —"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," I said. "I'm still confused. Matholch? Was he
the wolf I saw?"</p>
<p>"He was."</p>
<p>"You spoke of him as though he were a man."</p>
<p>"He <em>is</em> a man — at times. He is lycanthropic. A
shape-changer."</p>
<p>"A werewolf? That's impossible. It's a myth, a bit of crazy
folklore."</p>
<p>"What started the myth?" Edeyrn asked. "Long ago, there were
many gateways opened between the Dark World and Earth. On Earth,
memories of those days survive as superstitious tales. Folklore.
But with roots in reality."</p>
<p>"It's superstition, nothing else," I said flatly. "You actually
mean that werewolves, vampires and all that, exist."</p>
<p>"Ghast Rhymi could tell you more of this than I can. But we
cannot wake him for such a matter. Perhaps I — well, listen. The
body is composed of cells. These are adaptable to some extent. When
they are made even more adaptable, when metabolism is accelerated
sporadically, werewolves come into being."</p>
<p>The sweet, sexless child's voice spoke on from the shadow of the
hood. I began to understand a little. On Earth, college biology had
showed me instances of cells run wild — malignant tumors and the
like. And there were many cases of "wolf-men," with thick hair
growing like a pelt over them. If the cells could adapt themselves
<em>quickly,</em> strange things might occur.</p>
<p>But the bones? Specialized osseous tissue, not the rigidly
brittle bones of the normal man. A physiological structure that
could, theoretically, so alter itself that it would be wolf instead
of man, was an astounding theory!</p>
<p>"Part of it is illusion, of course," Edeyrn said. "Matholch is
not as bestial in form as he seems. Yet he <em>is</em> a
shape-changer, and his form does alter."</p>
<p>"But how?" I asked. "How did he get this power?"</p>
<p>For the first time Edeyrn seemed to hesitate. "He is — a
mutation. There are many mutations among us, here in the Dark
World. Some are in the Coven, but others are elsewhere."</p>
<p>"Are you a mutation?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"A — shape-changer?"</p>
<p>"No," Edeyrn said, and the thin body under the robe seemed to
shake a little. "No, I cannot change my shape, Lord Ganelon. You do
not remember my — my powers?"</p>
<p>"I do not."</p>
<p>"Yet you may find me useful when the Rebels strike again," she
said slowly. "Yes, there are mutations among us, and perhaps that
is the chief reason why the probability-rift came ages ago. There
are no mutants on Earth — at least not our type. Matholch is not
the only one."</p>
<p>"Am I a mutant?" I asked very softly.</p>
<p>The cowled head shook.</p>
<p>"No. For no mutant may be sealed to Llyr. As you have been
sealed. One of the Coven must know the key to Caer Llyr."</p>
<p>The cold breath of fear touched me again. No, not fear. Horror,
the deadly, monstrous breathlessness that always took me when the
name of Llyr was mentioned.</p>
<p>I forced myself to say, "Who is Llyr?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"Who speaks of Llyr?" a deep voice behind me asked. "Better not
to lift <em>that</em> veil, Edeyrn!"</p>
<p>"Yet it may be necessary," Edeyrn said.</p>
<p>I turned, and saw, framed against the dark portiere, the rangy,
whipcord figure of a man, clad as I was in tunic and trunks. His
red, pointed beard jutted; the half-snarling curve of his full lips
reminded me of something. Agile grace was in every line of his wiry
body.</p>
<p>Yellow eyes watched me with wry amusement.</p>
<p>"Pray it may not be necessary," the man said. "Well, Lord
Ganelon? Have you forgotten me, too?"</p>
<p>"He has forgotten you, Matholch," Edeyrn said, "At least in this
form!"</p>
<p>Matholch — the wolf! The shape-changer!</p>
<p>He grinned.</p>
<p>"It is Sabbat tonight," he said. "The Lord Ganelon must be
prepared for it. Also, I think there will be trouble. However, that
is Medea's business, and she asks if Ganelon is awake. Since he is,
let us see her now."</p>
<p>"Will you go with Matholch?" Edeyrn asked me.</p>
<p>"I suppose so," I said. The red-beard grinned again.</p>
<p>"Ai, you <em>have</em> forgotten, Ganelon! In the old days you'd
never have trusted me behind your back with a dagger."</p>
<p>"You always knew better than to strike," Edeyrn said. "If
Ganelon ever called on Llyr, it would be unfortunate for you!"</p>
<p>"Well, I joked," Matholch said carelessly. "My enemies must be
strong enough to give me a fight so I'll wait till your memory
comes back, Lord Ganelon. Meanwhile the Coven has its back to the
wall, and I need you as badly as you need me. Will you come?"</p>
<p>"Go with him," Edeyrn said. "You are in no danger — wolf's bark
is worse than wolf's bite — even though this is not Caer Llyr."</p>
<p>I thought I sensed a hidden threat in her words. Matholch
shrugged and held the curtain aside to let me pass.</p>
<p>"Few dare to threaten a shape-changer," he said over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>"I dare," Edeyrn said, from the enigmatic shadows of her saffron
cowl. And I remembered that she was a mutant too — though not a
lycanthrope, like a red-bearded werewolf striding beside me along
the vaulted passage.</p>
<p>What was — Edeyrn?</p>
