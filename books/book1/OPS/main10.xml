In Ghast Rhymi's Tower</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>QUIETLY Lorryn and I crouched among the trees and looked out at
the Castle of the Coven, aglitter with lights against the starry
sky. This was the night! We both knew it, and we were both tense
and sweating with a nervous exultation that made this waiting hard
indeed.</p>
<p>All around us in the woods, unseen, we heard the tiny sounds
that meant an army of forest people waited our signal. And this
time they were here in force. I caught a glint of starlight now and
then on rifle-barrels, and I knew that the rebels were armed to put
up a good fight against the soldiers of the Coven.</p>
<p>Not, perhaps, too good a fight.</p>
<p>I did not care. They thought they were going to storm the Castle
and the Coven by sheer force of arms. I knew their only purpose was
to divert attention while I made my way into the Castle and found
the secret weapons that would give me power over the Covenanters.
While they were striking, I would make my way to Ghast Rhymi and
learn what was essential for me to learn.</p>
<p>After that, I did not care. Many foresters would die. Let them.
There would still be slaves aplenty for me when my hour came. And
nothing could stop me now. The Norns fought with me; I could not
fail… .</p>
<p>There was much activity within the Castle. Voices floated out to
us in the still night air. Figures moved to and fro against the
lights. Then great gates were flung open upon a burst of golden
radiance and the outlines of many riders crowded against it. A
procession was coming out.</p>
<p>I heard chains clash musically, and I understood. This time the
sacrifices rode chained to their mounts, so that no siren voices
from the wood could lure them away. I shrugged. Let them go to
their death, then. Llyr must be fed while he lasted. Better these
than Ganelon, offered at the Golden Window. We saw them go off down
the dark road, their chains ringing.</p>
<p>That was Matholch — there on the tall horse. I knew his vulpine
outlines, the lift of the cloak upon his shoulders. And I would
have known him too because of the great start, quickly checked,
that Lorryn made beside me. I heard the breath whistle through his
nostrils, and his voice grated in my ear.</p>
<p>"Remember! That is mine!"</p>
<p>Edeyrn went by, tiny on her small mount, and a breath of chill
seemed to me to sweep the darkness as she passed.</p>
<p>Medea came!</p>
<p>When I could no longer make out her outlines in the distance,
when her white robe was no more than a shimmer and her scarlet
cloak had melted into the dark, I turned to Lorryn, my mind
spinning, my plans already chaotic with change. For a new
compulsion had come upon me, and I was not even trying to resist
it.</p>
<p>I had not seen a sacrifice in Caer Secaire. This was one of the
blank places in my memory, and a dangerous blank. Until Ganelon
remembered the Sabbat, until he watched Llyr accept the offerings
through the Golden Window, he could not wholly trust himself to
fight the Coven and Llyr. This was a gap that must be filled. And
curiosity was suddenly very strong upon me. Curiosity — and could
it be — the pull of Llyr?</p>
<p>"Lorryn, wait for me here," I whispered in the darkness. "We've
got to make sure they enter Caer Secaire, start the Sabbat. I don't
want to attack until I'm sure. Wait for me." He stirred
protestingly, but I was away before he could speak.</p>
<p>I was out upon the road and running softly and silently after
that processional winding toward the valley and the Mass of St.
Secaire, which is the Black Mass. It seemed to me as I ran that the
fragrance of Medea's perfume hung upon the air I breathed, and my
throat choked with the passion of my hatred for her, and of my
love.</p>
<p>"She shall be the first to die," I promised myself in the dark…
.</p>
<p>I watched the great iron doors of Caer Secaire swing shut upon
the last of the procession. The Caer was dark inside. They went
quietly in, one by one, and vanished into the deeper night within.
The doors clanged resonantly after them.</p>
<p>Some memory of Ganelon's, buried beneath the surface of
conscious thought, urged me to the left, around the curve of the
great wall. I followed the impulse obediently, moving almost like a
sleep-walker toward a goal I did not know. Memory took me close
under the looming rampart, made me lay my hands on its surface.
There were heavy scrollings of pattern there, writhing like
tendrils over the dark walls. My remembering fingers traced the
curves, though my mind still wondered.</p>
<p>Then the wall moved beneath my hands. The scroll-work had been a
key of sorts, and a door sank open in the blackness before me. I
went confidently forward, out of black night, through a black door
into deeper blackness within. But my feet knew the way.</p>
<p>A stairway rose beneath me in the dark. My feet had expected it
and I did not stumble. It was very curious to move so blindly
through this strange and dangerous place, not knowing where or why
I moved, yet trusting my body to find the way. The stairs wound up
and up.</p>
<p>Llyr was here. I could feel his hungry presence like a pressure
on the mind, but many times intensified because of the narrow
spaces within these walls, as if he were a sound of thunder
reverberating again and again from the enclosed spaces of the Caer.
Something within me reverberated soundlessly in answer, a roar of
exultation that I suppressed in quick revolt.</p>
<p>Llyr and I were no longer linked by that ceremony of long ago. I
repudiated it. I was not Llyr's Chosen now. But within me a sense I
could not control quivered with ecstasy at the thought of those
sacrifices who had fled blindly through the great doors of Caer
Secaire. And I wondered if the Coven — if Medea — thought of me
now, who had so nearly stood with the sacrifices last night.</p>
<p>My feet paused upon the stairs. I could see nothing, but I knew
that before me was a wall carved with scroll-patterns. My hands
found it, traced the raised designs. A section of darkness slid
sidewise and I was leaning upon a wide ledge, looking down, very
far down.</p>
<p>Caer Secaire was like a mighty grove of columns whose capitals
soared up and up into infinite darkness. Somewhere above, too high
for me to see its source, a light was beginning to glow. My heart
paused when I saw it, for I knew that light — mat golden radiance
from a Golden Window.</p>
<p>Memory came fitfully back to me. The Window of Llyr. The Window
of Sacrifice. I could not see it, but my mind's eye remembered its
glow. In Caer Llyr that Window's substance shone eternally, and
Llyr Himself lolled behind it — far behind it — forever. But in
Caer Secaire and in the other temples of sacrifice that had once
dotted the Dark World, there were replicas of the Window which
glowed only when Llyr came bodilessly through the dark to take his
due.</p>
<p>Above us, hovering and hungry, Llyr was dawning now in that
golden radiance, like a sun in the night time of the temple. Where
the Window of Secaire was located, how it was shaped, I still could
not remember. But something in me knew that golden light and
shivered in response as I watched its brilliance strengthen through
the columns of the temple.</p>
<p>Far below me I saw the Coven standing, tiny figures
foreshortened to wedges of colored cloak — green-robed Matholch,
yellow-robed Edeyrn, red Medea. Behind them stood a circle of
guardsmen. Before them, as I watched, the last of the chosen slaves
moved blindly away among the columns. I could not see where they
were going, but in essence I knew. The Window was yawning for its
sacrifices, and somehow they must make their way to it.</p>
<p>As the light broadened, I saw that before the Coven stood a
great cup-shaped altar, black on a black dais. Above it a lipped
spout hung. My eyes traced the course of the trough which ended in
the spout, and I saw now that there was a winding, descending
curve, dark against that growing light, which came down in a great
sweep from the mysterious heights overhead, stretching from — the
Window? — to the cupped altar. A stir deep within me told me what
that trough was for. I leaned upon the sill, shaking with an
anticipation that was half for myself and half for Him, who hovered
above us in the sun-like dawning of golden light.</p>
<p>Thinly from below me rose a chant. I knew Medea's voice, clear
and silver, a thread of sound in the dimness and the silence. It
rose like incense, quivering among the mighty, topless columns of
Secaire.</p>
<p>A tenseness of waiting grew and grew in the dim air of the
temple. The figures below me stood motionless, heads lifted,
watching the dawning light. Medea's voice chanted on and on.</p>
<p>Time paused there in the columned grove of Secaire, while Llyr
hovered above us waiting for her prey.</p>
<p>Then a thin and terrible cry rang out from the heights overhead.
One scream. The light shot out blindingly in a great burst of
exultation, like a voiceless answering cry from Llyr Himself.
Medea's chant rose to a piercing climax and paused.</p>
<p>There was a stir among the columns; something moved along that
curve of trough. My eyes sought the altar and the lipped spout
above it.</p>
<p>The Coven was rigid, a cluster of frozen figures, waiting.</p>
<p>Blood began to drip from the spout.</p>
<p>I do not know how long I hung there on the ledge, my eyes
riveted to the altar. I do not know how many times I heard a cry
ring out from above, how many times Medea's chant rose to a hungry
climax as the light burst forth in a glory overhead and blood
gushed into the great cup of the altar. I was deaf and blind to
everything but this. I was half with Llyr at his Golden Window,
shaken with ecstasy as he took his sacrifices, and half with the
Coven below, glorying in their share of the ceremony of the
Sabbat.</p>
<p>But I know I waited too long.</p>
<p>What saved me I do not know now. Some voice of the ego crying
unheard in my mind that this was time dangerously spent, that I
must be elsewhere before the Sabbat ended, that Lorryn and his men
waited endlessly while I hung here battening like a glutton upon
Llyr's feast.</p>
<p>Reluctantly awareness returned to my mind. With an infinite
effort I pulled myself back from the brink of that Golden Window
and stood reeling in the darkness, but in my own body again, not
hovering mindlessly with Llyr in the heights above. The Coven was
still tense below me, gripped in the ecstasy of the sacrifice. But
for how long I could not be sure. Perhaps for the rest of the
night; perhaps for only an hour. I must hurry, if hurrying were not
already futile. There was no way to know.</p>
<p>So I went back in the darkness, down the unseen stairs, and out
of the dark, unseen door, and back along the road to Coven Castle,
my mind still reeling with remembered ecstasy, the glow of the
Window still before my dazzled eyes, and the scarlet runnel above
the altar, and the thin, sweet chanting of Medea louder in my ears
than the sound of my own feet upon the road… .</p>
<p>The red moon was far down the sky when I came back to Lorryn,
still crouching beside the castle wall and half mad with
impatience. There was an eager stir among the unseen soldiers as I
came running down the road, a forward surge as if they had waited
to the very limit of endurance and would attack now whether I gave
the word or no.</p>
<p>I waved to Lorryn while I was still twenty feet away. I was
careless now of the Castle guardsmen. Let them see me. Let them
hear.</p>
<p>"Give the signal!" I shouted to Lorryn. "Attack!"</p>
<p>I saw him start up beside the road, and the moonlight glinted
upon the silver horn he lifted to his lips. Its blare of signal
notes ripped the night to tatters. It ripped away the last of my
lethargy too.</p>
<p>I heard the long yell that swept the forest as the woodsmen
surged forward to the attack, and my own voice roared unbidden in
reply, an ecstasy of battle-hunger that matched the ecstasy I had
just shared with Llyr.</p>
<p>The rattle of rifle-fire drowned out our voices. The first
explosions of grenades shook the Castle, outlining the outer walls
in livid detail. There were shouts from within, wild trumpetings of
signal horns, the cries of confused guardsmen, leaderless and
afraid. But I knew they would rally. They had been trained well
enough by Matholch and by myself. And they had weapons that could
give the woodsmen a stiff fight.</p>
<p>When they recovered from this panic there would be much blood
spilled around the outer walls.</p>
<p>I did not wait to see it. The first explosions had breached the
barriers close beside me, and I scrambled recklessly through the
gap, careless of the rifle fire that spattered against the stones.
The Morns were with me tonight. I bore a charmed life, and I knew I
could not fail.</p>
<p>Somewhere above me in the besieged towers Ghast Rhymi sat
wrapped in his chill indifference, aloof as a god above the
struggle around Coven Castle. I had a rendezvous with Ghast Rhymi,
though he did not know it yet.</p>
<p>I plunged into the gateway of the Castle, heedless of the
milling guards. They did not know me in the darkness and the
confusion, but they knew by my tunic I was not a forester, and they
let me shoulder them aside.</p>
<p>Three steps at a time, I ran up the great stairway.</p>
