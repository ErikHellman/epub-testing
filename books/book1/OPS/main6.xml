Men of the Forest</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>FROM out of the dark woods, suddenly, startlingly, a
trumpet-note rang upon the air. In the same instant there was a
wild crashing in the underbrush, an outburst of shouts and cries,
and the night was laced by the thin lightnings of unfamiliar
gunfire. The road was suddenly thronging with green-clad figures
who swarmed about the column of slaves ahead of us, grappling with
the guards, closing in between us and the mindless victims at our
forefront.</p>
<p>My horse reared wildly. I fought him hard, forcing him down
again, while stirrings of the old red rage I had felt before
mounted in my brain. Ganelon, at sight of the forest people,
struggled to take control. Him too I fought. Even in my surprise
and bewilderment, I saw in this interruption the possibility of
succor. I cracked my rearing horse between the ears with clubbed
rein-loops and struggled to keep my balance.</p>
<p>Beside me Medea had risen in her stirrups and was sending bolt
after arrowy bolt into the green melee ahead of us, the dark rod
that was her weapon leaping in her hand with every shot. Edeyrn had
drawn aside, taking no part in the fight. Her small cowled figure
sat crouching in the saddle, but her very stillness was alarming. I
had the feeling she could end the combat in a moment if she
chose.</p>
<p>As for Matholch, his saddle was empty. His horse was already
crashing away through the woods, and Matholch had hurled himself
headlong into the fight, snarling joyously. The sound sent cold
shudders down my spine. I could see that his green cloak covered a
shape that was not wholly manlike, and the green people veered away
from him as he plunged through their throngs toward the head of the
column.</p>
<p>The woodsfolk were trying a desperate rescue. I realized that
immediately. I saw too that they dared not attack the Coven itself.
All their efforts were aimed at overpowering the robot-like guards
so that the equally robotlike victims might be saved from Llyr. And
I could see that they were failing.</p>
<p>For the victims were too apathetic to scatter. All will had long
ago been drained away from them. They obeyed Orders — that was all.
And the forest people were leaderless. In a moment or two I
realized that, and knew why. It was my fault. Edward Bond may have
planned this daring raid, but through my doing, he was not here to
guide them. And already the abortive fight was nearly over.</p>
<p>Medea's flying fiery arrows struck down man after man. The
mindless guards fired stolidly into the swarms that surged about
them, and Matholch's deep-throated, exultant, snarling yells as he
fought his way toward his soldiers were more potent than weapons.
The raiders shrank back from the sound as they did not shrink from
gunfire. In a moment, I knew, Matholch would reach his men, and
organized resistance would break the back of this unguided
mutiny.</p>
<p>For an instant my own mind was a fierce battleground. Ganelon
struggled to take control, and Edward Bond resisted him
savagely.</p>
<p>As Ganelon I knew my place was beside the wolfling; every
instinct urged me forward to his side. But Edward Bond knew better.
Edward Bond too knew where his rightful place should be.</p>
<p>I shoved up my golden mask so that my face was visible. I drove
my heels into my horse's sides and urged him headlong down the road
behind Matholch. The sheer weight of the horse gave me an advantage
Matholch, afoot, did not have. The sound of drumming hoofs and the
lunging shoulders of my mount opened a way for me. I rose in the
stirrups and shouted with Ganelon's deep, carrying roar:</p>
<p>"Bond! Bond! Edward Bond!"</p>
<p>The rebels heard me. For an instant the battle around the column
wavered as every green-clad man paused to look back. Then they saw
their lost leader, and a great echoing hail swept then- ranks.</p>
<p>"Bond! Edward Bond!"</p>
<p>The forest rang with it, and there was new courage in the sound.
Matholch's wild snarl of rage was drowned in the roar of the forest
men as they surged forward again to the attack.</p>
<p>Out of Ganelon's memories I knew what I must do. The foresters
were dragging down guard after guard, careless of the gunfire that
mowed their disordered ranks. But only I could save the prisoners.
Only Ganelon's voice could pierce the daze that held them.</p>
<p>I kicked my frantic horse forward, knocking guards left and
right, and gained the head of the column.</p>
<p>"In the forest!" I shouted. "Waken and run! Run hard!"</p>
<p>There was an instant forward surge as the slaves, still tranced
in their dreadful dream, but obedient to the voice of a Coven
member, lurched through the thin rank of their guard. The whole
shape of the struggle changed as the core of it streamed
irresistibly forward across the road and into the darkness of the
woods.</p>
<p>The green-clad attackers fell back to let the slaves through. It
was a strange, voiceless flight they made. Not even the guards
shouted, though they fired and fired again upon the retreating
column, their faces as blank as if they slept without dreams.</p>
<p>My flesh crawled as I watched that sight — the men and women
fleeing for their lives, the armed soldiers shooting them down, and
the faces of them all utterly without expression. Voiceless they
ran and voiceless they died when the gun-bolts found them.</p>
<p>I wrenched my horse around and kicked him in the wake of the
fleeing column. My golden mask slipped sidewise and I tore it off,
waving to the scattering foresters, the moonlight catching brightly
on its gold.</p>
<p>"Save yourselves!" I shouted, "Scatter and follow me!"</p>
<p>Behind me I heard Matholch's deep snarl, very near. I glanced
over one shoulder as my horse plunged across the road. The
shape-changer's tall figure faced me across the heads of several of
his soldiers. His face was a wolflike snarling mask, and as I
looked he lifted a dark rod like the one Medea had been using. I
saw the arrow of white fire leap from it, and ducked in the
saddle.</p>
<p>The movement saved me. I felt a strong tug at my shoulders where
the blue cape swirled out, and heard the tear of fabric as the bolt
ripped through it and plunged hissing into the dark beyond. My
horse lunged on into the woods.</p>
<p>Then the trees were rustling all about me, and my bewildered
horse stumbled and tossed up his head, whinnying in terror. Beside
me in the dark a soft voice spoke softly.</p>
<p>"This way," it said, and a hand seized the bridle.</p>
<p>I let the woodsman lead me into the darkness.</p>
<p>It was just dawn when our weary column came at last to the end
of the journey, to the valley between cliffs where the woodsmen had
established their stronghold. All of us were tired, though the
blank-faced slaves we had rescued trudged on in an irregular column
behind me, unaware that then" feet were torn and their bodies
drooping with exhaustion.</p>
<p>The forest men slipped through the trees around us, alert for
followers. We had no wounded with us. The bolts the Coven shot
never wounded. Whoever was struck fell dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>In the pale dawn I would not have known the valley before me for
the headquarters of a populous clan. It looked quite empty except
for scattered boulders, mossy slopes, and a small stream that
trickled down the middle, pink in the light of sunrise.</p>
<p>One of the men took my horse then, and we went on foot up the
valley, the robot slaves crowding behind. We seemed to be advancing
up an empty valley. But when we had gone half its length, suddenly
the woodsman at my right laid his hand upon my arm, and we paused,
the rabble behind us jostling together without a murmur. Around me
the woodsmen laughed softly. I looked up.</p>
<p>She stood high upon a boulder that overhung the stream. She was
dressed like a man in a tunic of soft, velvety green, cross-belted
with a weapon swinging at each hip, but her hair was a fabulous
mantle streaming down over her shoulders and hanging almost to her
knees in a cascade of pale gold that rippled like water. A crown of
pale gold leaves the color of the hair held it away from her face,
and under the shining chaplet she looked down and smiled at us.
Especially she smiled at me — at Edward Bond.</p>
<p>And her face was very lovely. It had the strength and innocence
and calm serenity of a saint's face, but there was warmth and humor
in the red lips. Her eyes were the same color as her tunic, deep
green, a color I had never seen before in my own world.</p>
<p>"Welcome back, Edward Bond," she said in a clear, sweet gently
hushed voice, as if she had spoken softly for so many years that
even now she did not dare speak aloud.</p>
<p>She jumped down from the boulder, very lightly, moving with the
sureness of a wild creature that had lived all its lifetime in the
woods, as indeed I suppose she had. Her hair floated about her as
lightly as a web, settling only slowly about her shoulders as she
came forward, so that she seemed to walk in a halo of her own pale
gold.</p>
<p>I remembered what the woodsman Ertu had said to me in Medea's
garden before her arrow struck him down.</p>
<p>"Aries could convince you, Edward! Even if you're Ganelon, let
me take you to Aries!"</p>
<p>I stood before Aries now. Of that I was sure. And if I had
needed any conviction before that the woodsmen's cause was mine,
this haloed girl would have convinced me with her first words. But
as for Ganelon —</p>
<p>How could I know what Ganelon would do?</p>
<p>That question was answered for me. Before my lips could frame
words, before I could plan my next reaction, Aries came toward me,
utterly without pretense or consciousness of the watching eyes. She
put her hands on my shoulders and kissed me on the mouth.</p>
<p>And that was not like Medea's kiss — no! Aries' lips were cool
and sweet, not warm with the dangerous, alluring honey-musk of the
red witch. That intoxication of strange passion I remembered when I
had held Medea in my arms did not sweep me now. There was a — a
purity about Aries, an honesty that made me suddenly, horribly
homesick for Earth.</p>
<p>She drew back. Her moss-green eyes met mine with quiet
understanding. She seemed to be waiting.</p>
<p>"Aries," I said, after a moment.</p>
<p>And that seemed to satisfy her. The vague question that had
begun to show on her face was gone.</p>
<p>"I wondered," she said. "They didn't hurt you, Edward?"</p>
<p>Instinctively I knew what I had to say.</p>
<p>"No. We hadn't reached Caer Secaire. If the woodsmen hadn't
attacked — well, there'd have been a sacrifice."</p>
<p>Aries reached out and lifted a corner of my torn cloak, her slim
fingers light on the silken fabric.</p>
<p>"The blue robe," she said. "Yes, that is the color the sacrifice
wears. The gods cast their dice on our side tonight, Edward. Now as
for this foul thing, we must get rid of it."</p>
<p>Her green eyes blazed. She ripped the cloak from me, tore it
across and dropped it to the ground.</p>
<p>"You will not go hunting again alone," she added. "I told you it
was dangerous. But you laughed at me. I'll wager you didn't laugh
when the Coven slaves caught you! Or was that the way of it?"</p>
<p>I nodded. A slow, deep fury was rising within me. So blue was
the color of sacrifice, was it? My fears hadn't been groundless. At
Caer Secaire I would have been the offering, going blindly to my
doom. Matholch had known, of course. Trust his wolf-mind to
appreciate the joke. Edeyrn, thinking her cool, inhuman thoughts in
the shadow of her hood, she had known too. And Medea?</p>
<p>Medea!</p>
<p>She had dared betray me! Me, <em>Ganelon!</em></p>
<p>The Opener of the Gate, the Chose of Llyr, the great Lord
Ganelon! They dared! Black thunder roared through my brain. I
thought: By Llyr, but they'll suffer for this! They'll crawl to my
feet like dogs. Begging my mercy!</p>
<p>Rage had opened the floodgates, and Edward Bond was no more than
a set of thin memories that had slipped from me as the blue cloak
had slipped from my shoulders — the blue cloak of the chosen
sacrifice, on the shoulders of the Lord Ganelon!</p>
<p>I blinked blindly around the green-clad circle. How had I come
here? How dared these woodsrunners stand in defiance before me?
Blood roared in my ears and the woodland swam around me. When it
steadied I would draw my weapon and reap these upstarts as a mower
reaps his wheat.</p>
<p>But wait!</p>
<p>First, the Coven, my sworn comrades, had betrayed me. Why,
<em>why!</em> They had been glad enough to see me when they brought
me back from the other world, the alien land of Earth. The woodsmen
I could slay whenever I wished it — the other problem came first.
And Ganelon was a wise man. I might need these woods-people to help
me in my vengeance. Afterward — ah, afterward!</p>
<p>I strove hard with memory. What could have happened to turn the
Coven against me? I could have sworn this had not been Medea's
original intention — she had welcomed me back too sincerely for
that. Matholch could have influenced her, but again, why, why? Or
perhaps it was Edeyrn, or the Old One himself, Ghast Rhymi.-In any
case, by the Golden Window that opens on the Abyss, they'd learn
their error!</p>
<p>"Edward!" a woman's voice, sweet and frightened, came to me as
if from a great distance. I fought my way up through a whirlpool of
fury and hatred. I saw a pale face haloed in floating hair, the
green eyes troubled. I remembered.</p>
<p>Beside Aries stood a stranger, a man whose cold gray eyes upon
mine provided the shock I needed to bring me back to sanity. He
looked at me as if he knew me — knew Ganelon. I had never seen the
man before.</p>
<p>He was short and sturdy, young-looking in spite of the gray
flecks in his close-cropped beard. His face was tanned so deeply it
had almost the color of the brown earth. In his close-fitting green
suit he was the perfect personification of a woodsrunner, a glider
through the forest, unseen and dangerous. Watching the powerful
flex of his muscles when he moved, I knew he would be a bad
antagonist. And there was deep antagonism in the way he looked at
me.</p>
<p>A white, jagged scar had knotted his right cheek, quirking up
his thin mouth so that he wore a perpetual crooked, sardonic
half-grin. There was no laughter in those gelid gray eyes,
though.</p>
<p>And I saw that the circle of woodsmen had drawn back, ringing
us, watching.</p>
<p>The bearded man put out his arm and swept Aries behind him.
Unarmed, he stepped forward, toward me.</p>
<p>"No, Lorryn," Aries cried. "Don't hurt him."</p>
<p>Lorryn thrust his face into mine.</p>
<p>"Ganelon!" he said.</p>
<p>And at the name a whisper of fear, of hatred, murmured around
the circle of woodsfolk. I saw furtive movements, hands slipping
quietly toward the hilts of weapons. I saw Aries' face change.</p>
<p>The old-time cunning of Ganelon came to my aid.</p>
<p>"No," I said, rubbing my forehead. "I'm Bond, all right. It was
the drug the Coven gave me. It's still working."</p>
<p>"What drug?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," I told Lorryn. "It was in Medea's wine that I
drank. And the long journey tonight has tired me."</p>
<p>I took a few unsteady paces aside and leaned against the
boulder, shaking my head as though to clear it. But my ears were
alert. The low murmur of suspicion was dying.</p>
<p>Cool fingers touched mine.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear," Aries said, and whirled on Lorryn. "Do you think
I don't know Edward Bond from Ganelon? Lorryn, you're a fool!"</p>
<p>"If the two weren't identical, we'd never have switched them in
the first place," Lorryn said roughly. "Be sure, Aries. Very
sure!"</p>
<p>Now the whispering grew again. "Better to be sure," the woodsmen
murmured. "No risks, Aries! If this is Ganelon, he must die."</p>
<p>The doubt came back into Aries' green eyes. She thrust my hands
away and stared at me. And the doubt did not fade.</p>
<p>I gave her glance for glance.</p>
<p>"Well, Aries?" I said.</p>
<p>Her lips quivered.</p>
<p>"It can't be. I know, but Lorryn is right. You know that; we can
take no risks. To have the devil Ganelon back, after all that's
happened, would be disastrous."</p>
<p>Devil, I thought. The devil Ganelon. Ganelon had hated the
woodsfolk, yes. But now he had another, greater hatred. In his hour
of weakness, the Coven had betrayed him. The woods-folk could wait.
Vengeance could not. It would be the devil Ganelon who would bring
Caer Secaire and the Castle crashing down about the ears of the
Coven!</p>
<p>Which would mean playing a careful game!</p>
<p>"Yes, Lorryn is right," I said. "You've no way of knowing I'm
not Ganelon. Perhaps you know it, Aries — " I smiled at her " — but
there must be no chances taken. Let Lorryn test me."</p>
<p>"Well?" Lorryn said, looking at Aries.</p>
<p>Doubtfully she glanced from me to the bearded man.</p>
<p>"I — very well, I suppose."</p>
<p>Lorryn barked laughter.</p>
<p>"My tests might fail. But there is one who can see the truth.
Freydis."</p>
<p>"Let Freydis test me," I said quickly, and was rewarded by
seeing Lorryn hesitate.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said at last. "If I'm wrong, I'll apologize now.
But if I'm right, I'll kill you, or try to. There's only one other
life I'd enjoy taking the more, and the shape-changer isn't in my
reach — yet."</p>
<p>Again Lorryn touched his scarred cheek. At the thought of Lord
Matholch, warmth came into his gray eyes; a distant ember burned
for an instant there. I had seen hatred before. But not often had I
seen such hatred as Lorryn held for — the wolfing?</p>
<p>Well, let him kill Matholch, if he could! There was another,
softer throat in which I wanted to sink my fingers. Nor could all
her magic protect the red witch when Ganelon came back to Caer
Secaire, and broke the Coven like rotten twigs in his hands!</p>
<p>Again the black rage thundered up like a deluging tide. That
fury had wiped out Edward Bond — but it had not wiped out Ganelon's
cunning.</p>
<p>"As you like, Lorryn," I said quietly. "Let's go to Freydis
now."</p>
<p>He nodded shortly. Lorryn on one side of me, Aries, puzzled and
troubled, on the other, we moved up the valley, surrounded by the
woodsfolk. The dazed slaves surged ahead.</p>
<p>The canyon walls closed in. A cave-mouth showed in the granite
ahead.</p>
<p>We drew up in a rough semi-circle facing that cavern. Silence
fell, broken by the whispering of leaves in the wind. The red sun
was rising over the mountain wall.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness came a voice, deep, resonant, powerful.</p>
<p>"I am awake," it said. "What is your need?"</p>
<p>"Mother Freydis, we have helots captured from the Coven," Aries
said quickly. "The sleep is on them."</p>
<p>"Send them in to me."</p>
<p>Lorryn gave Aries an angry look. He pushed forward.</p>
<p>"Mother Freydis!" he called.</p>
<p>"I hear."</p>
<p>"We need your sight. This man, Edward Bond — I think he is
Ganelon, came back from the Earth-world where you sent him."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"Send him into me," the deep voice finally said. "But first the
helots."</p>
<p>At a signal from Lorryn the woodsfolk began herding the slaves
toward the cavemouth. They made no resistance. Empty-eyed, they
trooped toward that cryptic darkness, and one by one, vanished.</p>
<p>Lorryn looked at me and jerked his head toward the cavern. I
smiled.</p>
<p>"When I come out, we shall be friends again as before." I
said.</p>
<p>His eyes did not soften.</p>
<p>"Freydis must decide that."</p>
<p>I turned to Aries.</p>
<p>"Freydis shall decide," I said. "But there is nothing to fear,
Aries. Remember that. I am not Ganelon."</p>
<p>She watched me, afraid, unsure, as I stepped back a pace or
two.</p>
<p>The silent throng of woodsfolk stared, waiting warily. They had
their weapons ready. I laughed softly and turned. I walked toward
the cave-mouth. The blackness swallowed me.</p>
