<p>Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 â€“ June 5, 1900) was an American
novelist, short story writer, poet and journalist. Prolific
throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist
tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and
Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the
most innovative writers of his generation. The eighth surviving
child of highly devout parents, Crane was raised in several New
Jersey towns and Port Jervis, New York. He began writing at the age
of 4 and had published several articles by the age of 16. Having
little interest in university studies, he left school in 1891 and
began work as a reporter and writer. Crane's first novel was the
1893 Bowery tale Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, which critics
generally consider the first work of American literary Naturalism.
He won international acclaim for his 1895 Civil War novel The Red
Badge of Courage, which he wrote without any battle experience. In
1896, Crane endured a highly publicized scandal after acting as a
witness for a suspected prostitute. Late that year he accepted an
offer to cover the Spanish-American War as a war correspondent. As
he waited in Jacksonville, Florida for passage to Cuba, he met Cora
Taylor, the madam of a brothel with whom he would have a lasting
relationship. While en route to Cuba, Crane's ship sank off the
coast of Florida, leaving him marooned for several days in a small
dinghy. His ordeal was later described in his well-known short
story, "The Open Boat". During the final years of his life, he
covered conflicts in Greece and Cuba, and lived in England with
Cora, where he befriended writers such as Joseph Conrad and H. G.
Wells. Plagued by financial difficulties and ill health, Crane died
of tuberculosis in a Black Forest sanatorium at the age of 28. At
the time of his death, Crane had become an important figure in
American literature. He was nearly forgotten, however, until two
decades later when critics revived interest in his life and work.
Stylistically, Crane's writing is characterized by descriptive
vividness and intensity, as well as distinctive dialects and irony.
Common themes involve fear, spiritual crisis and social isolation.
Although recognized primarily for The Red Badge of Courage, which
has become an American classic, Crane is also known for his
unconventional poetry and heralded for short stories such as "The
Open Boat", "The Blue Hotel", "The Monster" and "The Bride Comes to
Yellow Sky". His writing made a deep impression on 20th century
writers, most prominent among them Ernest Hemingway, and is thought
to have inspired the Modernists and the Imagists.</p>
